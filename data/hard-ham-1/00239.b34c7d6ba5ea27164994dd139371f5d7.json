Ask her/him to co-sponsor the DMCRA today!\n\nRepresentatives Rick Boucher and John Doolittle recently introduced\nthe Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act (DMCRA, H.R. 5544), which\nwould require labelling on usage-impaired \"copy-protected\" compact\ndiscs and would make several several amendments to 1998's infamous\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\n\nTake action here:\nhttp://action.eff.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=2224\n\nJoin EFF! For membership information see:\nhttp://www.eff.org/support/\n\n-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n* ALERT: Bait and Switch; Anticounterfeiting Bill Hurts Your Rights!\n\nDon't be fooled by Senator Biden's \"Anticounterfeiting Amendments of\n2002\" (S. 2395, also known as \"the Biden Bill\"). It started as an\nattempt to stop organized crime from forging holograms and\ncounterfeiting money, but its scope has been greatly expanded to\ninclude digital watermarks on copyrighted material. This is a sneaky\npower-grab that would greatly diminish the rights of the public in\ncopyrighted works while expanding the power of copyright owners. It\ngoes well beyond the scope of current copyright law and could:\n\n~ Prevent universities, libraries, and consumers from enjoying the\nexceptions to the Copyright Act adopted by Congress. S. 2935 could\nprohibit the use of interface information essential for software\ninteroperability and competition\n\n~ Impose new responsibilities on Internet service providers and could\nalso require consumer electronics and computer manufacturers to\nreconfigure their products.\n\n~ Impose more severe criminal and civil penalties than permitted by\nthe Copyright Act for identical behavior\n\nThis \"anticounterfeiting\" bill is a decoy; stand up for your rights\ntoday!

Recently we have learned about a\nCanadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal\ninformation website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem\nespecially egregious.\n\nLawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been\npublished since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued\nby Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group.\nQuicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name\nLAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website\nunder that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of\nthe Quicklaw.com website that offers public \"teasers\" in the form of\nsummaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available\nthrough the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian\nlawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially\ndifferent, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed\ncomputer service and the other for information freely available on the\npublic internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more\nproblematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the\nterm LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed\nrequests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark\nauthorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a\nCanadian trademark issued for \"lawsnet.\"\n\nRegardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia\nthrough over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a\ncourt order requiring her to undergo an extensive \"discovery\" process\nthat threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free\nlegal assistance in the past, this next phase will require\nsignificantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can\nmuster. Quicklaw is represented by a large Toronto firm, Borden Ladner\nand Gervais, LLP.\n\nAbuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even\nbeen granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is\nunfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw,\nand its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and\nuseful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark\nis causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant\nownership in words, especially descriptive words like \"laws\" and \"net\"\nwhen describing an online legal information service. Trademark law\nshould also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal\ninformation (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop\nindividuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free\nlegal information to the public.\n\nFor those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local Toronto lawyer and\npart-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a\nlegal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help,\nplease contact:\n\nMr. Gil Lan\nBarrister & Solicitor\n393 University Avenue\nSuite 2000\nToronto, Ontario, M5G 1E6\n\nor by email at:\nglan@globalbusinesslaw.com\n\nor Ling Xia at:\neditor@lawsnet.com\n\n-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Give Twice as Many Gifts this Holiday Season!\n\nEFF has signed up with ShopsThatGive.com, a portal site for dozens of\nonline shops that donates a portion of their referral fees to a\ncharity of your choice.
