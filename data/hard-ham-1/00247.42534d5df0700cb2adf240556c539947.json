And after reading the phrase for what seemed like\nthe umpteen-thousandth time, we were idly wondering how many Irish\ntech companies blamed their misfortunes \"on the global downturn\":\nhttp://makeashorterlink.com/?S35A63392\n\nOh, so it's about 450 then.  Thanks, Google.\n\n*\n\nThe death occurred recently of that great Irish washtub musician\nLonnie Donegan.  RIP.  This seems like an apt time therefore to\nreflect on his many accomplishments: his virtuoso playing of\nutensil-based instruments, his worldwide commercial success, his\nplace in history as King of Skiffle, and how he wiped billions of\nyen off the value of the Tokyo stock market:\nhttp://groups.google.com/groups?selm=373A9C4F.61B@time.life\n(\"panic and subsequent 10+% decline of Tokyo Stock Exchange when Reuters\nadvised 'Lonnie Donnegan' was dead\")\nand also at\nhttp://xsls.com?80\n(\"to Japanese ears it sounded like Ronald Reagan\").\n\n*\n\nUCD's Literary and Historical Society this week awarded an honorary\nfellowship to the tediously brilliant American multidisciplarian Dr\nNoam Chomsky.  Now the idea of some trifling college society\nawarding a mere honorary fellowship actually sounds rather like an\ninsult to us, considering that Niall Quinn and Marian Finucane were\ngiven *degrees* by DIT the very next day, but then Chomsky\napparently inspired some of Radiohead's most caterwaulingly blunted\nsongs, so we suppose it serves him right.  Anyway, if you're an\nadmirer of the great man's hermeutic genius, linguistic philosophy\nor contentious views on US foreign policy, perhaps you might also\nappreciate his amazing interview of Tom Hanks:\nhttp://www.sadiethepilot.com/aaweb/tapes.htm#tomnnoam\n\nVery special thanks to IMHO's London correspondent Ray Butler for\nthis one.\n\n*\n\nKey IMHO contributor Sean Lynch quite realistically predicts a post-\nBudget dole queue for all of us, and wonders if we'll miss those\ncash-and-job cow multinationals when they're gone?   Not if their\nIrish presence was as permanent and impressive as \"the world's\nleading risk and insurance services firm\", he concludes:\nhttp://www.marsh.ie\n(compare and contrast with, say, http://www.marsh.co.uk/)\n\n*\n\nAlso: we've been remiss in the past in not featuring\nEircomTribunal.com's stalwart and righteous campaigning against\nEircom's crippling rates and crippled infrastructure in this\ncountry.  Well, we aim to redress that right now, by pointing out\n(1) Their 'Banana Republic' international price comparison page at\nhttp://www.eircomtribunal.com/dossier_banana_rep.html, which will\nsurely make you mad enough to\n(2) Download and print out their marvellously bitter \"No More\nFavours For You, Mr Eircom Employee\" flyer from\nhttp://www.eircomtribunal.com/counterstrike_a2_nomore.html, designed\nto be stuck under the windshields of the ubiquitous and bilious\nblue/orange Eircom vans.\nNow if only EircomTribunal.com could somehow could retrieve that\nmoney we all lost on bloody Eircom shares...\n\n\n                          * * * * * * * * *\n\n\nIMHO'S PICK: JOB....................IMHO HO HO (AND A BOTTLE OF RUM)\n\n\"FATHER CHRISTMAS on a bike - Student - Giving out FREEBIES - Four\nweeks\".

It's about\ntime we had an Irish SANTACON - after all, no force on earth can\nstop one hundred Santas, especially if they're drunk:\nhttp://www.santarchy.com/\n(from the San Francisco Police Report, \"the naughty Santas ... had\nreeked (sic) havoc in the emporium ... in an un-Christmas like\nfashion.\")\n\n*\n\nHeh.  Disproving the stereotype that all accountants are boring:\nsome Dublin 2 company is looking for a \"Parti-time bookkeeper\" at\nhttp://xsls.com?83\n\n*\n\nOur attention-deficient gaze also fell briefly this week onto a box\nad in a Sunday paper which is seeking private investors for an\nADVENTURE SPORTS RETAILING business in Dublin.  Now this probably\njust means selling snowboards or something equally tame, but in our\nimagination we see IMHO readers hunting elephants, dogfighting in\nbiplanes over the Wicklow Hills and abseiling down moon craters.\nJust in case we're right, any \"smart, experienced partner/investor\"\nlooking for an \"equity stake/board position\" should \"express\"\n\"interest\" to neptune@atomic.ie.\n\nYou know, it might look like we're giving these people free\nadvertising, but by putting their email addresses on the public web,\nwe're actually GUARANTEEING them spam...\n\n\n                          * * * * * * * * *\n\n\nIMHO'S PICK: EVENT...........................Allow Us To Demonstrate\n\nFriday is BUY NOTHING DAY.  For the sake of your own mental health\nand the socio-economic future, we urge you to give it a try.  It's\nnot that hard to get through 24 hours without a purchase, and those\ncorporate balance sheets sure look funny with a big pre-Christmas\nhole in them.\n\nThe official home of BND is of course Adbusters\n(http://adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/) and they have a run-down of\nIrish activities at http://xsls.com?84... rather a disappointing line-up\nat this late stage, although the Zombie-Shopping in Galway sounds\nlike fun - shame they're moving the day to Saturday, hopefully it's\nnot for purpose-defeating reasons (\"Friday?  Damn, I'm working the\nlate shift at McDonald's... how about Saturday?\").  In addition and\nelsewhere you can expect bring-and-trade markets, flypostering, free\nstuff, public speaking and all the other happy faces of democratic\nconsumer agitation.  Punk's not dead!  Party for your right to\nfight!  No Logo!  Hare Hare!  And so on.\n\n*\n\nWe're now going to risk life and limb by mentioning an event which\nis so diametrically opposed to the above that we might just bring\nabout the heat-death of the Internet by combining them in the one\nnewsletter.\n\nWe speak of course of the benighted and spiritually-denuded sickness\nof the TRILOGY FASHION SHOW in the RDS on December 4th, tickets\nstarting at \"just E50\" (but rising to E395 + VAT, natch).  The\nadvertising for this bleak celebration focuses entirely on \"the most\nbeautiful women in the world\" who will grace the Simmonscourt\nPavilion with their airbrushed emptiness: Tyra Banks, Sophie Dahl\nand Anna Kournikova (not the virus) are the only names we recognise.\nYou have to pore pretty closely over the small print of the press\nads to divine that it's the \"new Escada Collection\" (the who now?)\nthey're modelling.  And in an utterly appropriate and inevitable\npartnership, tickets are available from the cultural sewage\ntreatment system that is Ticketmaster.\nhttp://www.cslassociates.ie/events/trilogy_fashion.htm\n\n\n                          * * * * * * * * *\n\n\nIMHO'S PICK: DOWNLOAD..................Transparent and Unaccountable\n\nGiven our internet focus and the subversive nature of our scurrilous\npublishing agenda, there is only one possible download\nrecommendation this week.  It's the brilliant GHOSTZILLA browser, a\ncreation of architectural genius which brings office escapism to\nheady new heights.\n\nDesigned to facilitate inconspicuous worktime browsing, Ghostzilla\nsits quietly and invisibly in the background until you summon it\nwith a special mouse movement.  It then adapts itself to your\ncurrently-uppermost application, for example Micro$oft Word, leaving\nWord's toolbars intact while showing web pages in a subtle grayed-\nout wash in the main window.  Images appear in a subdued two-tone\nunless you summon them, and the overall effect is to make it look\nlike you're working exactly as you should be.  A casual glance from\nyour Office Space boss as he paces past your cubicle shouldn't\ndetect anything that looks like browsing.  To think that someone\ndevoted their life to creating something so wonderfully juvenile!\nIt's a beautiful thing.
