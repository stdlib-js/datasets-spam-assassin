Powell Chairman Federal Communications\nCommission 445 12th Street, S.W. Suite 8C453 Washington, DC 20554\n\n\nBY FACSIMILE, ELECTRONIC MAIL, AND POSTAL MAIL\n\nDear Chairman Powell:\n\nI am writing to you today in regards to the digital television\nBroadcast Flag; specifically, I write in response to Sen. Hollings'\nand Representatives Dingell and Tauzin's letters of July 19, which\nurged you to mandate the Broadcast Flag proposal outlined in the\nfinal report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported\nnon-profit organization that works to uphold civil liberties\ninterests in technology policy and law. EFF has played a critical\nrole in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to computers, the\nInternet and consumer electronics devices, defeating the restriction\non strong cryptography exports; securing the legal principle that\nInternet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a warrant;\nand defending academics, researchers and commercial interests\nagainst DMCA-related prosecution.\n\nEFF was an active participant in the Broadcast Protection Discussion\nGroup. We attended the group's meetings and conference calls and\nparticipated in the group's policy and technical mailing-lists. EFF\nalso maintains a web-site that was and is the only public source of\ninformation on the Broadcast Flag negotiations and proposal. The\nsite can be found at http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org. EFF devoted\nthousands of staff-hours to publicizing the existence and nature of\nthe BPDG to the public, to civil liberties and consumer-advocacy\ngroups, and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose\nproducts were threatened by the proceedings.\n\nWhen you and I met at Esther Dyson's PC Forum last March, we spoke\nbriefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined\nby the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group's mandate. The BPDG\nproposal will have grave consequences for innovation, free\nexpression, competition and consumer interests. Worst of all, it\nwill add unnecessary complexity and expense to the DTV transition,\ncompromising DTV adoption itself.\n\nAs you are aware, technologists have traditionally manufactured\nthose devices they believed would be successful in the market, often\nin spite of the misgivings of rights-holders. From the piano roll to\nthe PVR, technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever\nproducts they believe the public will pay for; what's more,\ninnovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest\nregulatory hurdles. NTSC tuners and devices are governed by precious\nfew regulations, and consequently we see a rich field of products\nthat interact with them, from the VCR Plus to tuner-cards for PCs to\nthe PVR. The Broadcast Flag proposal would limit technologists to\nshipping those products that met with the approval of MPAA member\ncompanies. No entrepreneur or software author will know, a priori,\nwhether his innovative DTV product will be legal in the market until\nhe has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to\nthe Hollywood studios for review.\n\nConsumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the \"Open\nSource\" or \"Free Software\" movement, in which technologies are\ndistributed in a form that encourages end-user modification. From\nserver-software like the web-wide success-story apache, to operating\nsystems like GNU/Linux, to consumer applications like the Mozilla\nbrowser, Free Software is a powerful force for innovation, consumer\nbenefit and commercial activity. The BPDG proposal implicitly bans\nFree Software DTV applications -- such as the DScaler de-interlacer\nand the GNU Radio software-defined radio program -- as these\napplications are built to be modified by end-users, something that\nis banned under the BPDG proposal. The tamper-resistance component\nof the BPDG's \"Robustness Requirements\" will create and entire class\nof illegal software applications, abridging the traditional First\nAmendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive\nspeech in code form under one of several Free Software/Open Source\nlicenses.\n\nThe BPDG nominally set out to create an objective standard, a bright\nline that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability\nwhen deploying their products. However, the end product of the BPDG\nwas a \"standard\" that contained no objective criteria for legal\ntechnology; rather, the standard required that new technologies be\napproved by MPAA member companies. Not uncoincidentally, the only\ntechnologies that were approved by the MPAA -- and hence the only\nlegal technologies -- were those produced by the 4C and 5C\nconsortia, a group of technology companies that acted as the MPAA's\nallies throughout the BPDG process. This is an harbinger of the sort\nof regime that the BPDG standard will usher in: technology companies\nwill be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by\nallying themselves with Hollywood, brokering deals to allow certain\ntechnologies and outlaw others.\n\nThe marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently\nproducing products that increase the value and desirability of new\ntechnologies, such as DTV. A BPDG mandate would subvert the market\nfor DTV innovation. Competing companies with lower-cost DTV\ntechnology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to\nmarket if they failed to assuage the MPAA's concerns about\nunauthorized redistribution. Furthermore, the universe of\nunauthorized-but-lawful uses for DTV programming will be shrunk down\nto the much smaller space of explicitly authorized uses. The ability\nof the public to make unauthorized-but-lawful uses of television\nprogramming has been an historical force for increasing the value of\nbroadcast programming, from the VCR to the PVR.\n\nIronically, the inevitable damage that a Broadcast Flag mandate\nwould do to innovation, competition and consumer interests can only\nslow down DTV adoption, by driving up the cost of DTV devices while\nreducing the number of desirable features that an open market would\ncreate. If the public is offered less functionality for more money,\nthey will not flock to DTV.\n\nThe most disheartening thing about the Broadcast Flag is that there\nis neither a strong case that the Broadcast Flag is a necessary tool\nfor protecting copyright, nor that the Broadcast Flag would be\neffective in that role. The existing practice of Internet\ninfringement of broadcast programming -- analog captures from\ndevices that satisfy the requirements of the BPDG proposal -- would\nnot be stopped by the presence of a Broadcast Flag.\nHigher-resolution DTV signals will likewise present no challenge to\ndetermined infringers, who can capture full-quality analog signal\nfrom DTV devices and then re-digitize them, suffering only a single\ngeneration's worth of loss-of-quality before the programming enters\nthe Internet.\n\nMeanwhile, the underlying rubric for a Broadcast Flag -- that\ninfringement will undermine Hollywood's business to the point that\nmovies will no longer be available to the public, reducing the value\nof DTV -- is no more than superstition. No credible study or\nanalysis, undertaken by a neutral party, has ever been presented to\nCongress, the FCC, the CPTWG or the BPDG supporting this notion. The\npublic is being asked to sacrifice its rights in copyright; industry\nis being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of\nentertainers; the US government is being asked to mandate\nextraordinary, unprecedented regulation of the $600 billion\ntechnology sector -- all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few\nstudio executives.\n\nEFF welcomes the FCC's oversight of the Broadcast Flag issue. The\nBPDG proceedings took place behind a shroud of secrecy, in a\nlooking-glass \"public process\" where only those participants the\norganizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its existence,\nwhere the co-chairs invented rules and processes on the fly to suit\nthe needs of the entertainment interests and the technology\ncompanies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly\nfor their products, where the press was banned.\n\nThe FCC has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public\nopinion in its proceedings. As the FCC considers the Broadcast Flag,\nEFF hopes that it will start anew, setting aside the findings of the\nBPDG in light of the concerns raised by Microsoft, Philips, Sharp,\nThomson, and Zenith, as well as non-profit organizations including\nEFF, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, the Free\nSoftware Foundation, Public Knowledge, digitalconsumer.org, the\nCenter for Democracy in Technology, and the Computer and\nCommunications Industry Association.\n\nThank you for attention in this matter. Please let me know if we can\nbe of any further assistance to you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nCory Doctorow for the Electronic Frontier Foundation\n\n\n\nLinks: \n\nEFF's BPDG Blog: \nhttp://bpdg.blogs.eff.org \n\nAn overview of our concerns with the broadcast flag:\nhttp://bpdg.blogs.eff.org/archives/one-page.pdf \n\nLetter from Sen.

Hamidi is now on appeal to the California Supreme\nCourt. EFF filed an amicus brief in support of Ken Hamidi on Aug. 6,\n2002. The facts are simple: Over about two years, Hamidi on six\noccasions sent e-mail critical of Intel's employment practices to\nbetween 8,000 and 35,000 Intel employees. Intel demanded that Hamidi\nstop, but he refused. Intel obtained an injunction barring Hamidi\nfrom e-mailing Intel employees at their Intel e-mail addresses,\nbased on the common-law tort of \"trespass to chattels.\" (\"Chattel\"\nis a legal term that refers to personal property, as opposed to\nproperty in land.)\n\nEFF's amicus brief argues three main points.\n\n(1) Intel did not qualify for relief under \"trespass to chattels\"\nbecause Intel's e-mail servers were not themselves harmed by\nHamidi's e-mails. If Intel was harmed, it was because the content of\nHamidi's e-mails affected Intel employees, not because sending the\ne-mails affected the functioning of Intel's servers.\n\n(2) By focusing on unwanted \"contact\" with the chattel and ignoring\nthe harm requirement, the court of appeal turned \"trespass to\nchattels\" into a doctrine that threatens common Internet activity\nlike search engines and linking. For example, if a website posted a\n\"no trespassing\" sign, any \"contact\" by a search engine could be\nconsidered a trespass even if it caused no harm.\n\n(3) The court of appeal wrongly held that the injunction did not\ninfringe Hamidi's freedom of speech. The First Amendment limits\nprivate parties' legal remedies in many areas of law, such as libel,\nout of concern that private parties will use the law to suppress\ncriticism. The same principle should apply here, where Intel's\nclaims of harm stem from the meaning of Hamidi's speech.\n\n\nLinks: \n\nThe Intel v.

It is now\nscheduled to be heard on December 9, 2002, in Oslo, Norway. In the\nfall of 1999, Johansen and his team reverse-engineered the content\nscrambling system (CSS) software used to encrypt DVDs in an effort\nto build a DVD player for the Linux operating system. In January of\n2002, the Norwegian Economic Crime Unit (OKOKRIM) charged Johansen\nwith a violation of Norwegian Criminal Code Section 145.2, which\noutlaws breaking into a third-party's property in order to steal\ndata that one is not entitled to. This prosecution marks the first\ntime the law will be used to prosecute a person for accessing his\nown property (his own DVD). Johansen faces two years in prison if\nconvicted. The prosecution is based on a formal complaint filed by\nthe Motion Picture Association.\n\nThe trial had originally been scheduled to take place in June of \n2002 but was rescheduled when the court could not find any qualified \njudges to hear Johansen's case.  Now the case is scheduled to be \nheard by a three-judge panel.

Huang's paper \"shows how a\nperson could defeat that system with a small hardware investment,\"\nsaid MIT Professor Hal Abelson, one of Huang's advisors. \"More\nimportantly, the paper relates the security vulnerability to a\ngeneral design flaw shared by other high-profile security systems\nsuch as the government's Clipper Chip and the movie industry's\nContents Scrambling System (CSS) for DVD players.\"\n\nHuang contacted EFF in March after his advisors told him that his\npreliminary findings raised potentially significant legal questions.\nWith the help of Boston College law professor Joe Liu, EFF worked\nwith Huang, Abelson, and MIT administrators to analyze the legal\nissues and draft letters notifying Microsoft of Huang's research\nfindings and intended publication, one of the steps encouraged by\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\n\nMicrosoft told Huang and Abelson that while it might prefer that the\npaper not be published, it would be inappropriate to ask MIT to\nwithhold the paper.\n\n\"Microsoft deserves praise for making no attempt to control\npublication,\" said Abelson. \"Their response shows that they value\nacademic freedom, and that they appreciate the critical role of\nunfettered research and publication in advancing technology.\"\n\nOther companies have reacted otherwise, using the DMCA to threaten\nresearchers. The Recording Industry Association of America last year\nwarned Princeton Professor Edward Felten after his research team\nexposed weaknesses in digital music security technologies. Last\nmonth, Hewlett Packard (HP) threatened research collective SnoSoft\nover exposing a security vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix operating\nsystem. Soon after, HP clarified that it would not use the DMCA to\nstifle research or impede the flow of information that would improve\ncomputer security.\n\nHuang said that while he is glad he can openly present his paper,\n\"The DMCA clearly had a chilling effect on my work. I was afraid to\nsubmit my research for peer review until after the EFF's efforts to\nclear potential legal restraints.\"\n\n\"Researchers should be analyzing security, not worrying about\ngetting sued,\" said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien.\n\nLinks:\n\nFor this release:\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/20020808_eff_bunnie_pr.html\n\nFor Huang's paper:\nftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/2002/AIM-2002-008.pdf\n\nFor the CHES program: http://islab.oregonstate.edu/ches/program.html\n\nEFF \"Unintended Consequences: Three Years Under the DMCA\" report:\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/20020503_dmca_consequences.pdf\n\nRIAA sues Professor Edward Felten over SDMI:\nhttp://www.eff.org/Legal/Cases/Felten_v_RIAA/\n\nAn article about Hewlett-Packard's threatening SnoSoft:\nhttp://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,54297,00.html\n\n- end -\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* EFF Thanks Defcon\n\nEFF thanks The Dark Tangent and other organizers of the DEF CON X\nconvention for their generous donation of exhibition space at DEF\nCON (http://www.defcon.org/).

The CD will contain at least 22\ncomplete novels, all in open formats like html and RTF, with the\nfair-use-friendly admonishment \"This disk and its contents may be\ncopied and shared but NOT sold.\" Included on the disk are the entire\nHonor Harrington series to date, as well as other titles from the\nBaen line, including Keith Laumer's *Retief!* and Larry Niven and\nJerry Pournelle's *Fallen Angels*.\n\nBaen has been a banner-carrier for fair-use in electronic\npublishing, shipping text and html files that can be played on a\nmultitude of devices. Other publishers have chosen to publish their\nmaterial in copy-controlled formats that make it impossible to\nlegally loan or resell the titles you purchase, are locked to a\nspecific device, can't play on every operating system, and\noccasionally lock out assistive technology like the screen-readers\nemployed by the blind.\n\nDmitry Skylarov, a Russian scientist, was arrested in July 2001, for\ndemonstrating how end-users could defeat the copy-prevention\nemployed by Adobe's e-book technology. Adobe asked the FBI to arrest\nSkylarov for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),\nwhich makes it a crime to describe techniques for circumventing\ncopy-prevention technology. Though Skylarov was later released, his\nemployer, ElcomSoft, is still facing charges in the USA, and the\nRussian government has issued an advisory warning Russian scientists\nto steer clear of American technical conferences until the DMCA is\nrepealed.\n\nHere is Baen's statement on the CD release:\n\nYou are about to start playing with a CD-ROM that has fairly\nextraordinary content. As of this writing it includes twenty-two\nUNENCRYPTED novels in several formats, the ten Honor Harrington\nNovels, 3 Honor Harrington Anthologies and 9 novels by friends of\nHonor, and by the time of distribution it may well contain more.\n(More than twenty novels for free, and with no stupid codes to work\naround. Think of that.) The reason for the plethora of formats is to\ntry to please the people who want to read the novels on their Palm\nPilots or other text-specialized palm-sized devices.\n\nLinks:\n\nBaen Books's page for *War of Honor*:\nhttp://www.baen.com/orientation.htm\n\nSlashdot discussion of *War of Honor* release:\nhttp://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/08/03/2314232&mode=flat&tid=\n149\n\nEFF documents on Dmitry Skylarov and ElcomSoft:\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/US_v_Elcomsoft/\n\nEFF documents on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA):\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/\n\n- end -\n\n* Singer/Songwriter Janis Ian on P2P Lucid article on the benefits of\npeer-to-peer networks form an artists' perspective.\nhttp://www.janisian.com/article-internet_debacle.html\n\n- end -\n\n* Hometown Paper Discusses Rep.
