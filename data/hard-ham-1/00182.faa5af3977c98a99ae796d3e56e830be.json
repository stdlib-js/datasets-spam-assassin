Secure IE\n02. Disk cleanup on XP\n03. Thanks but no thanks\n04. Mouseless way home\n05. Kartoo\n06. XP time feature\n07. Leaf Peeper Alert\n08. Saving scraps\n09. Quick access\n10. Don't believe your email\n\nAnd What's Coming Up Next Week in NNT Premium\n\n01. SECURE IE.  For the past month or so, our Software Review Panel has \nbeen giving a grueling test to Secure IE, a piece of software that blocks \nFlash and pop-ups, prevents malicious file downloads, lets you customize \nSecurity Zone settings as you browse dozens of Web sites simultaneously up \nto five times faster with a tabbed interface, annotate Web page with sticky \nnotes and highlighter, and save complete Web pages, even secure server \n(HTTPS) pages and archive online transaction receipts.  For what we believe \nis one of the most thorough reviews ever conducted on a single piece of \nsoftware, check out what our Panel had to say at \nhttp://www.NeatNetTricks.com/SoftwareReviews .  For a free trial download, \nvisit http://www.secureie.com .  And if this one sweeps you off your feet, \ngo to the NNT Store at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store and get a super \ndeal, just $17.50 if you order before September 14.  With a 30-day \nguarantee, what's to lose?\n\n02. DISK CLEANUP ON XP.  Windows XP users can do some fast cleaning chores \nwith Disk Cleanup.  Access this tool from the Start menu by right clicking \non your hard drive.  Then select Properties and click on the Disk Cleanup \nbutton to determine how many files can be safely deleted.\n\n03. THANKS BUT NO THANKS.  Continuing our periodic feature of \nless-than-useful sites on the Web:  The International Center for Bathroom \nEtiquette at http://www.icbe.org/ gets our recognition this issue.  It says \nit's working hard to bring you the latest in cutting edge research and \ntechnology regarding bathroom etiquette.  We'll resist some obvious puns.\n\n. . . . .\n\nWest Virginia's Diane Stratton recommended NNT to some friends and is now \nenjoying QuicKeys 2.0, a great Windows management software package.  Diane \nis our latest winner and you could be next.  Just go to the NNT Web site at \nhttp://www.NeatNetTricks.com and click on \"Recommend NNT.\"  Nothing could \nbe easier.\n\n. . . . .\n\n04. MOUSELESS WAY HOME.  To go home quickly in Internet Explorer, touch F6 \nto highlight the Address Bar and type two periods (..) there.  The Enter \nkey then takes you home.\n\n05. KARTOO.  Search engines are everywhere on the Internet but Kartoo at \nhttp://www.kartoo.net is quite unusual.  It's a meta search engine that \ndisplays results on a map in the form of a ball.  The larger the ball, the \nmore relevant the result.  As you mouseover each result, site descriptions \nare revealed.  If all that sounds confusing, the explanation is more \ncomplicated than the service itself.  Just try it.\n\n. . . . .\n\nYou should make it a habit to visit the NNT Store at \nhttp://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store . We try to have several great products \nthere at a limited-time price much less than anywhere else on the Net. \nCurrently, you'll find excellent ebooks, a very effective popup stopper, \nand the very useful utility described in item 01 above, along with the \nusual opportunity to subscribe to NNT Premium and ArchivesExpress.  Check \nus out, you'll be glad you did.\n\n. . . . .\n\n06. XP TIME FEATURE.  Windows XP added a nice feature that heretofore \nrequired a separate software application.  It will connect, either at a \nprogrammed time or manually, to a time server via the Internet and reset \nthat often erroneous internal clock.  Just click on the time in the systems \ntray, go to Date and Time Properties and click the Internet Time tab.\n\n07. LEAF PEEPER ALERT.  A bit early, but soon the changing colors of autumn \nwill begin here in the U.S.  For those who like to follow the display, \nconsider http://www.stormfax.com/foliage.htm for a comprehensive collection \nof links and toll-free numbers to each state to determine peak color times.\n\n08. SAVINGS SCRAPS.  Some oldies are worth repeating.  If you're working \nwith text in, for example, MS Word or WordPad, and would like a handy way \nto save a portion for later easy retrieval, just select (highlight) it and \nclick/drag it to your desktop.  When the newly created icon is clicked on, \nit will show the application with which the scrap was created, along with \nthe first few words of the text.  A double click opens the text in the \napplication with which it was created.\n\n09. QUICK ACCESS.  To go to a frequently used program, you may find \nyourself drilling down to the desktop and searching out the shortcut \nicon.  Consider instead setting up a key combination that will provide \nquick access without using the shortcut. Right click on the shortcut and \nselect Properties.  In the Shortcut key window, select any key you can \nremember and click OK.  Ctrl+Alt and that key will open the application \nwhenever needed.\n\n10.  DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EMAIL.  We've been asked about those emails with \nvirus attachments that appear to be coming from NNT, asking for a \nconfirmation of a subscription.  Don't believe it, and don't open the \nattachments.  Maybe this exchange between NNT and Lyris (our mail manager) \nwill clear things up:\n\nNNT: Is there anything that can be done about the current strains of virus \nthat implant on address books and randomly send email asking alleged \nsubscribers to verify their subscription (when they haven't subscribed at \nall)? I've received some of these as well, and I know it's become a \nwidespread problem with other ezine publishers, creating a lot of ill will \nall around.  Is there some configuration that we could change to keep \nthese from going out except to legitimate subscribers?\n\nLyris:  Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about this since it \nisn't actually ListManager doing the sending.  The real problem is that \npeople sometimes will add the \"join\" address to their address book and \nthat is what causes the problems.  The best we can do is advise people not \nto have their address books set to automatically add any email address \nthat they send a message to even once.  The main culprit here seems to be \nOutlook Express.\n\nWHAT'S COMING NEXT WEEK:  Another batch of Neat Net Tricks in the Premium \nissue, including:\n\n*  A great collection of information and free downloads to make your system \nmore secure.\n\n*  Free software to measure and display your real-time Internet speed.\n\n*  Can you handle still another popup stopper - that's interference free - \nand at no cost?\n\n*  An easy-to-use tool to store and arrange all your passwords, user IDs, \nand other info.\n\n*  A Microsoft Word tip to easily work around that pesky autocompletion \nfeature.\n\n*  A whole arsenal of tools to combat spam.\n\n*  Software that provides more than 200 interesting facts about your \ncomputer and displays about your CPU, memory, operating system, and your \ncomputer's power source.\n\n*  Our in-depth article discusses how to best manage our important \npasswords and get out of trouble when we -inevitably - forget those passwords.\n\nAnd more!
