Right now, John's\nright - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove\nrequests have in the entire past year.\n\nOne thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's\nadopted a technique by which they add headers to each message\nindicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is\nnot sent to \"majordomo\" - it is sent to \"listname-remove\"@domain.\nI've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail\naddr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in\na received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the\nsame box).\n\nFor all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal\ninstructions right in the bottom of your email, you will\n_still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,\nwe've been there.)\n\nThomas\n\n-\nnessus@list.nessus.org: general discussions about Nessus.\n* To unsubscribe, send a mail to majordomo@list.nessus.org with\n\"unsubscribe nessus\" in the body.\n"}
