In any case, this output is likely to be\nsomewhat cryptic.  One of the reasons is because this output often\nuses a set of standardized codes and it is simply easier to put more\ninformation on the screen using a short number than it is to write an\nessay about why some event happened.\n\nRead the entire tip at: \nhttp://www.searchNetworking.com/tip/1,289483,sid7_gci840618,00.html\n\n\nGot a VoIP tip of your own?

Delay is generally defined as the time it takes\nfrom the instant you speak into the phone until the instant that\nsound is regenerated on the far end.
