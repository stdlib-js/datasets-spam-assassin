If that's what\nthey did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former\njunk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd\nunauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty\nkeeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a\nbottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting\nnocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't\nhelp thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman\nvan's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't\ngonna be pretty.\n\n\nCloser to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were\nhustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on\nGrand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple\nof years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active\nshooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a\nfew days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff,\nreeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal\nexaminations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two,\ncourtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and\ngames with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog.\nHeck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed\nCaymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left.\n\n\nBesides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their\nactivities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too\nmuch in the way of \"escaped\" \"revenue\", or at least the perception of\nsame in the local \"free\" press. Obviously, if your money \"there\"\nisn't exchangeable into your money \"here\", it kind of defeats the\npurpose of keeping your money \"there\" in the first place, giving\nfolks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up\nfor renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line\ncredit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or\nquango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and\nthe US.\n\nAs a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while\nago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom\non that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes\nLuxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually\naccessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans\nthemselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling\nabout one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing\npretexts.\n\nAt this point, the \"legal\", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings\nare kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep\nmy money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where\na bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will\nclose it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned\nstatutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or\nimagined property rights are this afternoon.\n\n\nThe point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only\nsolution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private\ntransactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than \"transparent\"\ntransactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real*\ninteresting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal\nfreedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and\ngroom action figures sold separately, of course.\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n(Who went to FC2K at the Grand Cayman Marriott in February that year.\nNice place, I liked Anguilla better though, at least at the time, and\nI haven't been back to either since. The beaches are certainly better\nin Anguilla, and the \"private\" banking system there is probably just\nas porous as Cayman's is, by this point. If I were to pick up and\nmove Somewhere Free outside Your Friendly Neighborhood Unipolar\nSuperpower, New Zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and\nChile would be next, though things change quickly out there in\nballistic-missile flyover country. In that vein, who knows, maybe\nwe're in for some kind of latter-day Peloponnesian irony, and\n*Russia* will end up the freest place on earth someday. Stranger\nthings have happened in the last couple of decades, yes?)\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPVYS48PxH8jf3ohaEQKwtgCgw/XSwzauabEP/8jDvUVk/rgFdroAn0xf\nOwk90GoK+X5Pv+bGoKXCwzBK\n=1w9d\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
