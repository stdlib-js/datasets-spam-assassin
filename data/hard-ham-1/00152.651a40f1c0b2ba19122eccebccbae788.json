As for short-range\nmanagers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,\nexisting laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.\"\n\n       \"If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,\"\nsaid Dr. Brook, \"let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,\nregulations and making the market truly free.\"\n\n###   ###   ###\n\nAyn Rand Institute executive director Dr. Yaron Brook is available for\ninterviews on this topic.\n\nContact: Larry Benson\nE-mail: larryb@aynrand.org\nPhone: (949) 222-6550 ext. 213\n\nRead Dr. Brook's full Op-Ed at:\nhttp://www.aynrand.org/medialink/killingthestockmarket.shtml\n\nFor more information on ARI's unique point of view go to Medialink at the\nInstitute's Web site at www.aynrand.org.
