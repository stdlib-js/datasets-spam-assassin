INTRO.  [IBM DB2]\n1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY.\n2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE.\n3. BE A SF.NET FOUNDRY GUIDE.\n4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET\n5. SITE STATISTICS\n\n\n0. INTRO\n\nHello SourceForge.net Users,\n\nThis week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any\nlarge dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to\nthe web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.\nThese databases manage everything from user authentication, session\nmanagement, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-\ndependent website.\n\nToday we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,\na powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because\nthe site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and\n70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this\ngrowth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us\nthe resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the\npress release here:\n\nhttp://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html\n\nHow will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much\ndifference other then the site will continue to grow and the\nSourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later\nphases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of\nthe databases advanced capabilities.\n\nToday our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the\nsite will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.\n\nIf you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,\nplease feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always\nappreciate the feedback.\n\nThank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the\nOpen Source Community.\n\nPat-\n\nPatrick McGovern\nDirector, SourceForge.net\n\n\n\n1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY\n\nSourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth\nis never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to\nensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source\ncommunity can always obtain the software released by hosted\nprojects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity\ndownload servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,\nas to provide better download times regardless of which network\nprovider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.\n\nThree new download servers have recently been added to our network,\nfurther strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest\nadditions include servers hosted by:\n\nTime Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);\nhttp://www.twtelecom.com/\n\nUniversity of Minnesota (Minnesota, USA)\nhttp://www.umn.edu/\n\nCESNET (Czech Republic)\nhttp://www.cesnet.cz/\n\nWe thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and\nthe needs of the Open Source community.\n\nOn a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan.  If you are\nan ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a\nSourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us\nknow at bandwidth@sourceforge.net\n\n\n\n2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE\n\nSourceForge.net now has the audio from the entire 2002 OSDN/USENIX\nKernel Summit, held in June.

I didn't subscribe to this list!!!\nYou spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful\nphrases here)\".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net\nthere was a check box that said \"Receive Site-wide updates, low\nvolume\".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,\nhence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6\nweeks, so it truly is low volume.
