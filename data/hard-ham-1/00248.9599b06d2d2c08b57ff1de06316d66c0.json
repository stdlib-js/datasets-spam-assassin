A Wisconsin subscriber wrote to express his displeasure \nwith the links contained in Neat Net Tricks.  It seems he is bothered by \nthe frequent pop-up ads and he felt that only those sites without the ads \nshould be featured in NNT, particularly in the Premium issue. We replied \nthat pop-ups can be annoying but, while not defending them, we must realize \nthat they are a form of marketing in which the site owner hopes to recover \nhis costs and possibly make a profit.  We suggested using a pop-up stopper \n(there are lots of them on the Web) and ALT F4 will quickly close active \npop-up windows.  Finally, we pointed out that no publication can guarantee \nonly sites without pop-up ads.  As we've often said in the past, the \nInternet isn't free and never was.  Someone has to pay the freight and if \nthose ads are unprofitable, they will cease to exist.\n\n02. EXTENSION SEARCH.  Next time a file extension has you puzzled, try the \ndatabase at http://extsearch.com/ information.\n\n03. DUMB MESSAGES REVISITED.  Not long ago we mentioned a few dumb messages \nwe see from our computer and invited others to share their favorite \n\"dumbness.\"  A reader frequently gets a banner ad that asks \"Do you click \non banner ads.\"  She asks, if you don't, how do you click \"No\" without \nclicking on the banner ad? Others galled at their computers crashing, then \nsitting through the Scandisk operation and being reminded \"To avoid seeing \nthis screen again, always shut down Windows properly\" as if it was their \nfault. Another reader nominates the download site at \nhttp://www.microsoft.com/NTWorkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp \nfor having a really dumb comment.  After downloading a Windows update, it \nsays:  \"How to Get Started -- You don't need to do anything after \ndownloading\" and he asks, \"what's the point of downloading?\"  Still another \nreader nominates the instruction manual for the Windows Internet \nInformation Server (ILS) accessible only when ILS is operating.  Thus, the \nentire section on troubleshooting a nonfunctional installation is \ninaccessible at precisely the moment one needs to consult it.  But judging \nby the sheer quantity of email, the top dumb instruction has to be the \nmessage that \"Keyboard not detected, Press (whatever key) to \nContinue.\"  Keep them coming and we'll do it again in a future issue!\n\n04. XP TWEAK.  A recent article reminded readers of the neat things that \ncan be done with TweakUI, but the XP operating system was not supported by \nthe Tweak at that link.  Never fear, XP folks, you'll find a whole array of \npower tools included Tweak - all for XP - at \nhttp://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp .\n\n. . . . .\n\n1, 400+ Neat Net Tricks tips updated 4 times yearly for the word processing \nformat of your choice, also in ebook format, plus extra features, \ndownloadable and just $20 a year, a bargain (and a nice stocking stuffer \nfor Santa) at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store.\n\n. . . . .\n\n05. HARDWARE DIAGNOSTICS TOOL.  Windows98 users have a neat tool at their \nfingertips without downloading.  Click on Start and Run and enter \"hwinfo \n/ui\" without quotes.  The information displayed is color-coded.  Error \nmessages are in red, warnings are in blue.  Green denotes registry entries, \nConfiguration Manager information is in brown and file attributes are shown \nin magenta.\n\n06. TRAINING WINDOWS.  One pet peeve is Windows' determination to identify \na shortcut icon as \"Shortcut to (whatever)\"  This is pure redundancy, since \nshortcuts are identified by an arrow.  And, with the added verbage of \n\"Short cut to\" you can't jump from one icon to another by pressing the \nfirst letter (since they would all start with an \"s\".  If you keep removing \n\"Shortcut to,\" Windows will eventually understand your intent and future \nshortcuts won't include \"Shortcut to\".\n\n07. HOLD THAT BUTTON.  The site at http://www.holdthebutton.com/ invites \nyou to hold the mouse key down.  Now, before you hastily jump to \nconclusions that there's nothing more to this site, when you release the \nbutton, you are told how you rank in stamina with other button \nholders.  And when I took my turn at the controls, I found that the longest \nrecord was a little over six hours, proving once again that some folks need \nto get a life.\n\n08. HAGAI'S FREEWARE.  A baker's dozen (13) freeware programs are at \nhttp://www.hagai.com/download.asp?ProgType=Freeware . They include a bug \nchecker, screen saver loader, clock, shutdown utility, CD autorun, boot \neditor, menu, counter,icon viewer and editor, and more.\n\n09. ONLINE HELP.  Of limited scope, but considering that you can never get \nenough help with your computer, try http://www.computerhope.com/oh.htm .\n\n. . . . .\n\nApologies to those readers who were inconvenienced with multiple issues of \nNNT Issue #137.  As luck would have it, Lyris (our mail server) had \nhardware failure causing some of the repeated distribution. We'd like to \ntell you that there will never be another problem in future mailings, and \nif you'll buy that, as the song goes, we have some oceanfront property in \nArizona for sale.\n\n. . . . .\n\nIN NEXT WEEK'S NEAT NET TRICKS PREMIUM:  Google is generally accepted as \nthe most popular search engine, but we show you another free download that \nenhances Google, along with a way to \"Google\" without a browser.
