Encased in the skin of a sheep, he \npastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd \nby his costume. In the evening he was shut up by \nthe shepherd in the fold; the gate was closed, \nand the entrance made thoroughly secure. But the \nshepherd, returning to the fold during the night \nto obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly \ncaught up the Wolf instead of a sheep, and \nkilled him instantly. \nHarm seek. harm find. \n\n\n==================================================================\nYou are subscribed to Aesop's Fables as:\nmothlight@fastmail.fm\n\nIf you would like to unsubscribe, click on the link below.\n\nhttp://www.classic-novels.com/cgi-bin/arp3/arp3-un.pl?c=8530&p=5514\n==================================================================\nClassic Novels - In 5 Minutes A Day!\nCopyright 2002 Kevin S Peterson\nVisit us online at http://www.classic-novels.com\nor contact us at mailto:comments@classic-novels.com\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFun & Functional!
