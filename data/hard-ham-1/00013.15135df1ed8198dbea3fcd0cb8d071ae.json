Pick of the Week\n\n   DECK\n   Version: 3.5\n   File size: 6.6MB\n   License: Free to try; $399.00 to buy\n   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 9.x or Mac OS X\n\n   Looking for a professional, multitrack audio workstation\n   under OS X? This entry from BIAS, while maybe not the most\n   attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty\n   editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast,\n   film, video, or any other multimedia environment. The big\n   brother to BIAS' cheaper Deck LE, Deck 3.5 lets you process\n   soundtracks, edit dialogue, spot effects, and record\n   ADR-style voice-overs. Deck also supports surround mixing and\n   up to four real-time effects plug-ins per track for music\n   production. A good value, and one of the first of its kind\n   to hit OS X, this midrange app deserves a listen.

The Week in Wares\n\n   IN INTERNET:\n\n   CAPTAIN FTP\n   Version: 1.3\n   File size: 793K\n   License: Free\n   Minimum requirements: Mac OS X\n\n   Designed completely from scratch to work with OS X, Captain\n   FTP is a new client that makes finding, uploading, and\n   downloading files online easier than ever. Since it makes\n   full use of OS X's multithreaded multitasking capabilities,\n   you can set up as many simultaneous connections as you like\n   without slowing down other work on your Mac too much. The\n   program supports drag-and-drop operation and resuming\n   interrupted downloads. It also sports a built-in address\n   book, and integrated BBEdit links. The interface deserves\n   awards for clarity and good looks. Grab files in style:\n\n   http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=49-ZM4cIEpSenMA07qVX4RVXFO5JSFR \n\n   Want to review Captain FTP?

AquilaCalendar is\n   refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar\n   windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,\n   week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize\n   your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists\n   and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a\n   handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The\n   interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting\n   organized no more difficult than it has to be.

Even if you\n   don't, you should take this remake of the old classic for a\n   spin. Maneuver your way through a maze of corridors while\n   setting off bombs to clear a path for your escape. You'll\n   also need to pick up coins for extra points and stay clear\n   of those nasty aliens to stay alive. Blast your way through\n   eight alien-infested areas, each one divided into 10\n   subzones, and kick the Big Alien Boss back to where he came\n   from.
