I have had this laptop for three years, but I haven't turned it on for\nthe past two months. I look on its left side, I feel around the back, I\nfind it on the right and I feel like an idiot. The screen reads \"fatal\nerror\" and offers to \"save\" whatever I had typed on it last June 21st, a\nfew weeks before my mother died. I hit CTL.ALT.DEL. and it is gone. Gone.\nGone like this long, sad, summer, frozen now, and nothing seemingly matters\nbut everything matters more now than ever before. Why did she have to die?\nWhen will this pain stop? \n\nI got up this morning to fly out to Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival\nis screening my film tomorrow night, the first time it will be shown in the\nUnited States. My mother did not get to see this new film. She was always\nso proud of everything I did, cheering me on every day from the day where\nmy memory begins. I had shown an early cut of the film to my friends last\nwinter in my parent's living room, and mom would come in and out of the\nroom, catching a scene here and there, saying, \"Boy, that's something,\nisn't it!\" \n\nI don't feel right, right now. I have avoided most people for the past two\nmonths. I can't conceive in my mind having to face a crowd of strangers, no\nmatter how supportive or appreciative they may be. Everyone says to me it\nwill be good to get back to work, good to be busy, take my mind off my\nsadness, as if not aware that what I really might need is for it to be the\nother way around. At my family's insistence, I tried going on TV a few\nweeks ago to talk about the corporate crooks roaming our great land. I had\ndecided to give it a try, and gave it my best shot, and ended up feeling so\nempty and more alone. I had agreed to go on \"Crossfire\" and Donahue (thank\nGod for this guy!) on the condition that I would not have to have one of\nthose stupid cable news shouting matches with three rightwingnuts where no\none can hear (or wants to hear) what's being said. \n\nThey agreed to the terms, but as Bob Novak asked his first question about\naren't my true motives to destroy capitalism and make America a socialist\ncountry, I just sat there for a moment and didn't respond. I thought I\nwould just take the microphone off and leave - who needs these f-----s! -\nbut then, my dad was with me in the studio and I looked over at him and\nsmiled, and then into the camera I said, yes, Bob, that is exactly what I\nintend to do and, considering more people have bought my book than any\nother nonfiction book in America this year, I guess that means that the\nmajority of Americans agree with me on this point, so look out Bob 'cause\nwe're going to seize your money first! I asked the studio audience in DC\nfor a show of hands of all those who agreed and I was later told that\nnumerous hands shot up in the air, much to the chagrin of a stunned Bob\nNovak. I also added that I thought the Pope was onto something when he said\nthat capitalism is a \"sin.\"\n\nMy dad liked that. He is a sweet, strong, smart man and I loved the drive\nwith him back home. We took a spin through the Michigan State campus and he\ntold me how he had come down here after World War II to inquire about going\nto college but thought it best to return to the assembly line where he had\na secure job. His years during the war serving in the Marines were going to\nbe counted toward his seniority. And so he worked the spark plug and oil\nfilter assembly line for 33 years and provided for mom and us kids and gave\nus all his love -- which, of course, mattered the most. \n\n                      *        *       *       *       *        *\n\nDad took me to the airport this morning, remarking on the way how much mom\nwould have enjoyed this simple trip across town to Bishop Airport, how\nhappy she would have been knowing that I was heading off on a new journey\nin my very fortunate life. I thought about how she came to New York for the\nscreening of \"Roger & Me\" at the New York Film Festival in 1989, and how I\ngot to introduce her and my aunt as they sat in the front of the balcony,\nand how mom and Aunt Lois stood and took a long Lincoln Center bow, and how\nI stood on that stage and felt that she deserved every bit of that applause\nand more. \n\nIt's a bittersweet memory now, as I've just found out that the NYFF\nselection committee this year is too afraid to show my new film.\n\"Politics,\" is what I have been told. Too \"populist\" for the new elite who\nnow sit in judgment of what is art. \"They don't want to help further your\nplatform Mike,\" a person close to the committee tells me. \"One of them even\nsaid, 'I know this film is going to be popular - and I don't personally\nwant to contribute to its popularity.'\"  So, it was decided that \"Bowling\nfor Columbine,\" a Cannes prize-winner, knighted by the Chicago Tribune as\n\"one of the most effective political/polemical films ever,\" a film chosen\nby every single film festival around the world this fall - no, this film\nmust not be shown at Lincoln Center just six blocks from the edit room\nwhere we made it... 77 blocks north of ground zero. I've gone too far this\ntime, cut too close to the bone, stuck my lens where it doesn't belong -\nright straight through the heart of an America that is both master and\nvictim of the ultra-violence. It is so sad to see this place where I will\nalways remember my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos\nwho, like their counterparts in Hollywood, preside over the demolition of a\nonce great art form.\n\n                     *      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\nMy dad drops me off and goes to park in the short-term lot. He comes inside\njust as the airport personnel are taking everything out of my suitcase for\ninspection. They don't ask to see the print of the film, the only thing I\nmight have had on me that is poised to do any real damage (to all the right\npeople, of course). My dad and I stop short of the metal detectors and the\nnext round of inspectors who are anxious to look at my smelly feet. We hug,\nand he kisses me, and I am trying hard, so very hard, to not break down in\nthe middle of this airport. He tells me not to worry about him, and I tell\nhim I'll call him from Detroit when I am changing planes. I go through\nsecurity and as I am being taken aside to be searched again, I look back\nand see him still standing there, watching out for me. My dad.\n\nI'm on the plane and I'm thirsty, but I took the water bottle out of my bag\nwhen I packed it this morning. The bottle, half-drank, had been sitting\nuntouched in my untouched bag since I stuck it in there the night we had to\nrush my mom to the hospital. The bottle was still there in that overnight\nbag where I put my t-shirt and sweatpants, the ones I had on for the night\nand day I sat by my mother's side in the hospital as she struggled to live,\nholding her hand, holding her head, trying to comfort her, strands of hair\non my sweater. I can see the stains from where my tears and mucus ran\nuncontrollably down my face and onto that sweater. The doctor said she had\nan 80% chance of making it. An hour before she died, another doctor said\nthe chances were 1 in 100. That was good enough for me. One in one hundred!\nI've had those odds! I won! Don't let her die! Please do everything you can\ndo! Don't let her die.\n\nThe priest came, then another priest came, and when the priests left my dad\nasked us three kids and the three grandkids to all join hands and say our\ngoodbyes to mom, say whatever we wanted to about what she meant to us. (I\nam sorry... I cannot complete this paragraph right now, I can't see the\nscreen through the tears...maybe someday...)\n\nThe night before we rushed her to the hospital I had a little surprise\nplanned for her. I had brought a copy of my new movie and I was going to\nshow it to her. As the end credits would roll, she would get to see what\nshe has seen at the end of all of my work: her name along with my dad's in\nthat list of credits...and, to me, it's the only real credit that ever\nmattered -- because without them I would not have the life they gave me,\nthe way they raised me... it is all a privilege I will never cease being\nthankful for.\n\nI never got to show her the movie that night. \"Mike!\" she called out from\nthe porch, in a pitch of voice I had never heard. \"Get your father! I don't\nfeel good.\" She was, without warning, dying. Within 48 hours she would be\ngone.\n\n                 *          *          *          *          *          *\n\nI'm walking through the Detroit airport to gate 75 for the flight to\nDenver, and I hear someone say, \"OK, Mr. Stuckup, just walk right on by!\" I\nturn to see it is one of anchors from the local TV station in Flint. I\napologize. My sunglasses are on. I have been crying since I left my dad at\nthe Flint airport. I explain this to her and she starts to get tears in her\neyes. \"My mom died in October,\" she says, and I realize that this pain that\nfeels so solitary is, truthfully, a shared experience amongst us all. No\none is immune from this loss. But instead of taking the time to tell me\nabout how rough it has been for HER, she asks about how I am doing and how\nis my dad doing and did we get the flowers she and the others sent. She\ngives me her number and says to call anytime if I feel the need to talk. At\nthat moment I remember what she told me -- that her mother also died this\nyear-- and I think, man, get over yourself, Mike, you are not alone in\nthis, and so I ask her how she is doing. \"I think a lot,\" she says, \"about\nall the things she won't see my two children grow up to do, to be. But I\nbelieve she is in my heart, right here, right now, and she will see it\nall.\"\n\nThey call my flight and I rush over to the payphone to call my dad to see\nif he got home OK. He tells me that when he left the short- term lot he got\ntalking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother\ngetting cancer and how she was caring for her. \"She said that her bill in\nthe hospital came to $60,000,\" he says with astonishment. \"They won't be\nable to pay it. She makes six dollars an hour, no health insurance. I gave\nher a tip along with the toll.\"\n\n\"You gave the tollbooth worker a tip?\"\n\n\"Well, you have to. That person could be you or me.\"\n\nThat is my father. That was my mother. \n\nYours, \n\nMichael Moore\nmike@michaelmoore.com\nhttp://www.michaelmoore.com\n\nPS. Thank you, all of you, who sent me your condolences and who contributed\nto the local poverty program in my mother's name. I was so moved by your\ngenerosity and by your words of love and kindness. It will never be\nforgotten.\n\n\n---\n\nIf you wish to be be unsubscribed from this mailing list, please click the\nlink below and follow the instructions.\n\nhttp://www.michaelmoore.com/mailing/unsubscribe.php\n"}
