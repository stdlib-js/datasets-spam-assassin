One of the many\n  interesting films currently available is the Japanese crime\n  thriller \"Nobody\" from DivX partner Vanguard Cinema. Called \"a\n  triumph\" by the New York Times, \"Nobody\" is an action-packed\n  thriller-noir that tells a story of an escalating cycle of\n  violence and revenge. In the tradition of international crime\n  thrillers like \"La Femme Nikita\" and \"Tokyo Fist,\" \"Nobody\" takes\n  the viewer through a labyrinth of suspense and carnage without\n  release until the very end.\n\n* Watch \"Nobody\" in High-quality DivX Video:\n  <http://rd.mailshell.com/www.divx.com/showcase>\n\n\n  Mad Phat Crazy DivX Player Skins\n  ---------------------------------\n\n  The week's dopest DivX Player Skins:\n  \n* DivX 4 Real: Puts an interesting DivX spin on a familiar player\n  design--keeping it real.
