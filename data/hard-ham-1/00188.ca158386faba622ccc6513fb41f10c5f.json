EFF seeks to ensure that the legal\ndebate over DVRs will include consumers' concerns along with those of\nthe entertainment and consumer electronics industries.\n\nThe entertainment industry claims that commercial skipping infringes\ncopyright and digital recording aids piracy.\n\n\"I'm not a crook if I skip commercials or share a news interview of\nmyself with my mom using the SendShow feature rather than sending her\na videotape,\" said Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist.org and a\nReplayTV owner. \"I shouldn't have to worry about getting prosecuted,\nbut the Turner Broadcasting CEO tells us that taking a bathroom break\nis criminal. We even have Senators urging Attorney General Ashcroft to\nprosecute people who share files.\"\n\nAlong with Newmark, ReplayTV customers filing the lawsuit with legal\nrepresentation by the EFF are: Keith Ogden, owner of a financial\nbroker firm in San Francisco; Shawn Hughes, a small business owner in\nGeorgia; Seattle journalist Glenn Fleishman; and southern Californian\nvideo engineer Phil Wright.\n\nLinks:\n\nFor this release:\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/Video/Newmark_v_Turner/20020816_eff_pr.html\n\nCourt order denying dismissal and combining the ReplayTV cases:\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/Video/Newmark_v_Turner/20020816_consolidation_granted.html\n\nFor more information on the ReplayTV customers' suit:\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/Video/Newmark_v_Turner/\n\nFor more information on the entertainment industry's suit:\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/Video/Paramount_v_ReplayTV/\n\nEFF Fair Use FAQ:\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/eff_fair_use_faq.html\n\n- end -\n\n\n* Musician Disputes Industry's Stance on Music Sharing\n\n  Janis Ian Urges Artists Speak Out, Support Free Downloads\n\nSan Francisco - Grammy-winning songwriter and recording artist Janis\nIan today challenged the music industry by celebrating peer-to-peer\n(P2P) music sharing as a boon to musicians.\n\nIan, who is in the San Francisco Bay Area as part of her current\nconcert tour, recently published \"The Internet Debacle,\" a pointed\ncritique of the music industry's disregard for musicians and consumers\nwho want to distribute and acquire music online. The Electronic\nFrontier Foundation (EFF) applauds Ian's actions and hopes that others\nwill see the Internet as an aid, not a threat, to musicians.\n\nIn the article, Ian assails the major record labels' argument that P2P\nfile-sharing is harming artists.\n\n\"Free Internet downloads are good for the music industry and its\nartists,\" explains Ian. \"Every act that can't get signed to a major,\nfor whatever reason, can reach literally millions of new listeners,\nenticing them to buy the CD and come to the concerts.\"\n\nShe adds that during the heyday of Napster she saw a marked increase\nin CD sales from her website. She attacks technological and political\nmeasures meant to harm consumers by restricting their right to copy\nand back up their legally purchased music.\n\nIan will play on August 17 in San Rafael, CA.\n\nDuring her 17 album career, Ian has earned nine Grammy nominations and\nthree awards. Her best known songs include 1967's \"Society's Child\"\nand 1975's \"At Seventeen.\" More recently, her 1993 album \"Breaking\nSilence\" was nominated for a Grammy Award as Contemporary Folk Album\nof the Year. Her songs have been recorded by artists ranging from\nBette Midler to Cher, from Glen Campbell to Vanilla Fudge, and from\nJoan Baez to Etta James.\nLinks:\n\nFor this release:\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/20020815_eff_pr.html\n\nJanis Ian's \"Internet Debacle\" article:\nhttp://www.janisian.com/article-internet_debacle.html\n\nJanis Ian's follow-up article:\nhttp://www.janisian.com/article-fallout.html\n\nJanis Ian's tour information:\nhttp://www.janisian.com/tourinfo.html\n\n- end -\n\n\n* EFF CAFE 2002 - a Benefit for EFF's Campaign for Audiovisual \n  Free Expression\n\n  Support Free Expression and See Barney-Wheaton Deathmatch\n\n  Thursday, August 22nd, 2002/ 9pm - afterhours\n\nSan Francisco - Join the hottest DJs of the electronic dance music\nscene, celebrity boxers, and the foremost cyberspace activists as we\nparty to protect the future of music.

Pavlovich\nmaintained the mailing list for the LiVid programming group, which\nprovides a unified development and user resource center for video and\nDVD-related work for the Linux operating system. One of the group's\nprojects was to create a DVD player for computer systems that run\nLinux. As part of that effort, DeCSS, a program that decrypts the copy\nprotection on DVDs, was published on the group's mailing list. The\nentertainment industry has sued Pavlovich in California court, and\nlast year a California appellate court ruled Pavlovich was within the\nstate court's jurisdiction since he published information that relates\nto the entertainment industry, which is based in California.\n\nEFF and Pavlovich's legal team argue that Pavlovich is outside of\nCalifornia's jurisdiction since he was a college student in Indiana\nwith no contacts to California when DeCSS was published on the LiVid\nlist. The hearing on September 5 will take place in San Francisco.\nLinks:\n\nFor more info on the case:\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/DVDCCA_case/\n\n- end -\n\n\nDeep Links\nDeep Links is a new department in the EFFector featuring noteworthy\nnews items, victories and threats from around the Internet.\n\n* Lawrence Lessig's Second-to-Last Speech on Copyright\n\nLawrence Lessig gave one of his last public speeches on copyright at\nthe O'Reilly Open Source Conference.
