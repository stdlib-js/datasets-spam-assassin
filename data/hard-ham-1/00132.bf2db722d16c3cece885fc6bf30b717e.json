If you'd like to unsubscribe, follow\n  the instructions at the end of this message.)\n\n\n  In This Week's Issue\n  --------------------\n\n  1. Classic Battle of the Planets in DivX Video\n  2. Warcraft III with DivX Video Sells like Hotcakes\n  3. Skins, Skins and More Skins\n\n  \n  Battle of the Planets in DivX Video!\n  ------------------------------------\n  \n  One of the best things about DivX Video is the way it has opened\n  up distribution possibilities for a lot of cool videos that may\n  not otherwise be widely seen. From independent short films to cult\n  movies with strong underground followings, a number of filmmakers\n  and distributors are discovering that DivX Video provides a great\n  way to get their content in front of new audiences.\n  \n  A perfect example of that phenomenon is the groundbreaking\n  animated series \"Battle of the Planets\" from Sandy Frank\n  Entertainment. Originally shown on American television in the late\n  1970s, Battle of the Planets gained a popular following and was\n  one of the forerunners of the wildly popular anime style. The\n  series chronicled the adventures of a group of intergalactic\n  adventurers as they battled evil and protected the universe from\n  invaders. Beloved among anime fans, 70s nostalgia buffs, and\n  anyone who enjoys great sci-fi animation, the series is the\n  subject of a number of fan sites and discussion groups throughout\n  the Internet. You can now re-live the adventures of the Battle of\n  the Planets crew in high-quality DivX video. The classic episode\n  \"Mammoth Shark Menace\" is currently featured on the DivX Showcase,\n  and stay tuned for more news about future Battle of the Planets\n  episodes to come.\n\n* Watch \"Battle of the Planets 55: Mammoth Shark Menace\" in the\n  DivX Showcase:\n  <http://rd.mailshell.com/www.divx.com/showcase/detail.php?id=52>\n\n\n  Warcraft III Sets Sales Records\n  -------------------------------\n\n  A while ago, we told you that the highly anticipated game\n  \"Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos\" from Blizzard Entertainment would\n  feature DivX Video for cinematic cut scenes. In early July,\n  Blizzard released \"Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos\" with\n  record-setting results, shipping over 4.5 million copies to\n  retailers. Coincidence? You be the judge. You can look forward to\n  more announcements about DivX technology in some of your favorite\n  games in the near future....\n\n* Watch the \"Warcraft III\" Trailer in High-quality DivX Video:\n  <http://rd.mailshell.com/www.divx.com/showcase>\n\n* Read more about the successful launch:\n  \n<http://rd.mailshell.com/money.cnn.com/2002/07/17/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.ht\nm>\n  \n\n  The Latest DivX Player Skins\n  ----------------------------\n\n  Let's face it--if you don't have the latest Player skins, you're\n  just not cool.\n  \n* DisPlayer: A sleek, stylish full-screen skin that will give you\n  the home theatre experience on your PC.
