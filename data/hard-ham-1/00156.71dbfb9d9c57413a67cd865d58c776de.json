The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax \ncredit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees \ncarry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 \nbillion in goods and services, the audit found.\n\nIn one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and \ngovernment-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, \nthen spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to \nsupply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their \ntravel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.\n\n\"Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a \nstrip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling \nsuit?\" asked Dasbach. \"Americans who support a bigger defense budget, \ntake note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, \nreckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the \nworthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even \nimagine.\"\n\nOther spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury \ncruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and \narmchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.\n \nSome military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit \nnoted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can \nbe \"a useful tool for building good relations with a host country\" \nsuch as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. \n\nNot surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found \"little evidence of \ndocumented disciplinary action\" against those who misused the cards, \nso taxpayers may end up paying the tab.\n  \n\"It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat \nDefense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse \ntaxpayers for every penny of improper spending,\" he said.\n \n\"Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard \nagainst such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to \nforce the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, \ninstead of offending the taxpayer.\"\n\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.6.2\n\niQCVAwUBPUA6FdCSe1KnQG7RAQGAKwP/Zpfw0Uq3BPLnXXmnlWQ2aFFb1FSaj+nJ\nQOMt9q4TBhiYJhIdgdd+uGxoubiPfvyIweSR1PjOdoFe8dYf2h/V4gNS9hSmkSgC\n76RZVuitNf2DbEsaY8TtcUDLDC51m/jgxiGcgPkcyJ+0Wn11RRbktkVEefSNTaBz\nM8ibVFiDPyI=\n=9fYc\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Libertarian Party                                http://www.lp.org/\n2600 Virginia Ave. NW, Suite 100                    voice: 202-333-0008\nWashington DC 20037                                   fax: 202-333-0072\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor subscription changes, please use the WWW form at: \nhttp://www.lp.org/action/email.html\n\n\n"}
