We're proud to introduce our new Apparel\nand Accessories store with over 400 major clothing brands (including\nGap, Old Navy, Nordstrom, Lands' End, Target, Eddie Bauer, Foot\nLocker, and many more).\n\nOur goal is to provide complete apparel selection and offer it the\nAmazon wayï¿½-with easy navigation, a single shopping cart, your\nshipping and payment information already on file, etc. Of course, none\nof this would be possible without our many apparel store partners\n(we're thankful to have such an amazing group of companies working\nwith us).\n\nWe released a beta version of the Apparel store about a week ago, and\nmuch to our surprise, tens of thousands of clothing and accessory\nitems have already been ordered. Through the first few days of our\nbeta, customers have ordered:\n\n* 14,487 shirts (Polo Ralph Lauren button-downs to DKNY blouses)\n\n* 1,843 jackets (Old Navy fleece to Polartec windbreakers)\n\n* 2,712 sweaters (Eddie Bauer V-necks to Liz Claiborne cardigans)\n\n* 140 swimsuits (Tommy Bahama to Speedo)\n\n* 9,408 pants (Gap khakis to Guess jeans)\n\n* 485 skirts (Nordstrom suede to Spiegel leather)\n\n* 1,461 sleepwear items (Marshall Field's satin robes to Lands' End\n  flannel pajamas)\n\n* 3,254 pairs of shoes (Nike Air Max to Nine West boots)\n\n* 1,870 pairs of socks (Cole Haan cashmere-blend to OshKosh B'Gosh\n  cotton)\n\n* 2,805 accessories (handbags, watches, scarves, etc.)\n\n* 3,287 pairs of underwear (Jockey briefs to Hugo Boss boxers). We all\n  need clean underwear, right?\n\nWe hope you'll check it out. You'll get a $30 promotional certificate\nwhen you spend $50 or more in the new Apparel store (see details\nbelow).
