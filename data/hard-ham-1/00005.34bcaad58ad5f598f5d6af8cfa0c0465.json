Could It?\n10)  Subscription Information\n\n\n\nTHE ISO17799 TOOLKIT UNCOVERED\n==============================\n\nThe ISO17799 standard can be acquired either stand alone or as part of\nan introductory pack appropriately called 'The ISO17799 Toolkit'. But\nwhy was it packaged thus, and what is included in the pack?  \n\nThe purpose of the toolkit is to help organizations get off to a flying\nstart with respect to ISO17799... not only to understand the standard\nitself but to begin to address many of the standard's requirements more\nquickly.\n\nThe contents can be broken down into two groups: those that help the\norganization to understand where ISO17799 fits and what is involved in\nembracing it, and those that help an organization to take the first\ncritical steps to compliance.\n\nIn the former group are the 'RoadMap to Certification' (which broadly\ndescribes the process of gaining certification), the 'XL Management\nPresentation' (which explains the history, background and current status\nof the standard) and of course the ISO17799 standard itself (both\nparts).\n\nIn the latter group are some key items to aid compliance. These include\na comprehensive set of ISO17799 compliant security policies to address\nsection 3 (Security Policy) and business continuity audit checklists to\nhelp address section 11 (Business Continuity Management).\n\nIt doesn't end there, however. For the audit section there is a detailed\nset of audit questionnaires to address various issues and platforms. For\nnewcomers to information security there is even a substantial glossary\nof terms.  \n\nClearly, creating such a toolkit was a significant undertaking. However,\nin terms of helping organizations exploring the initial stages of\nISO17799, it can be invaluable. \n\nMore information on the ISO17799 Toolkit and how to purchase can be\nfound at: http://www.iso17799-made-easy.com\n\nThe standard itself can alternatively be procured from:  \nhttp://www.iso17799.net \n\n\n\nSOCIAL ENGINEERING - ARE YOU SUSCEPTIBLE?\n=========================================\n\nThe term 'social engineering' can conjure up a variety of ideas, usually\nbased around the concept of genetic tampering. However, when applied to\nIT security, it has its own implications and its own vocabulary.\n\nFollowing interviews with known computer criminals, a list of approaches\nhas been produced. These are designed to gather information without the\ntarget even realizing that they have parted with it.\n\nThe attempts are often made on an opportune bases, with common locations\nfor this sort of activity being planes, trains and pubs. The telephone\nis probably the major source of pre-meditated acts.  \n\nThe following are some of the major techniques employed:\n\nBAITING\nThis essentially involves asking a variety of questions, including some\nleading questions designed to 'catch' the right answers. Often, items of\nconversation are introduced based upon replies received. The fiction is\nlegitimized with small amounts of fact in the right places.\n\nPULLING RANK\nThis amounts ot the perpetrator assuming a more senior position in the\ncompany than the victim and is usually enacted on the telephone. It does\nnot necessitate direct impersonation... only the POSITION needs to be\nassumed. \n\nEXHAUSTING\nThis involves asking a constant stream of similar questions to wear down\nthe target.\n\nSURF BOARDING\nBasically this is looking over someone's shoulder at something\nconfidential. This could be directly, through a window, through a\ndoorway, etc.\n\nSURVEYS\nThe information given freely in surveys can often be extremely useful to\na criminal. The surveys can initially be for entirely legitimate\npurposes, or can be completely bogus from the start. In either case\nsensitive information can often be obtained and unwittingly disclosed.\n\n\nThere are of course many other techniques. However, disclosure can be\nprevented via the use of a series of common sense rules and policies. \n\nBefore releasing any information it is essential to at least establish:\n\na) the sensitivity of the information\nb) your authority to exchange or release the information\nc) the real identity of the third party (proper authentication)\nd) the purpose of the exchange\n\nThe act of exchange should also be recorded for audit purposes.\n\n\n\nISO17799 - A WORLD WIDE PHENOMINA =================================\n\nDisney would have said \"it's a small world after all\", but the global\ntake on of ISO17799 proves that organizations the planet over are\nembracing it with enthusiasm.\n\nTo illustrate the global nature of the standard, we recently created a\ntable from the last 500 purchases of the standard from the ISO17799\nElectronic Shop (www.iso17799.net). The figures below do come with a\nserious health warning though - the Electronic Shop is a credit card\npurchase system. Some cultures are not as comfortable or familiar as\nothers with credit card purchase and will therefore have their purchase\nposition significantly understated. An example is India, which acquires\nsubstantial numbers of the standard, only two of which show in the last\n500 from the download location.\n\nThat aside, the table makes interesting reading:\n\nArgentina 1 \nAustralia 6 \nAustria 5  \nBarbados 2 \nBelgium 5 \nBermuda 1 \nBosnia and Herzegovina 1 \nBrasil 2 \nBrazil 4 \nCanada 52 \nCayman Islands 1 \nChile 3 \nChina 3 \nColombia 5 \nCosta Rica 1 \nCroatia 1\nCyprus 1 \nDenmark 5 \nDeutschland 5  \nEgypt 4 \nEngland 26 \nFrance 3 \nGermany 20 \nGreece 3 \nGuatemala 1 \nHong Kong 7 \nHungary 1 \nIndia 2 \nIndonesia 2 \nIreland 11 \nIsle of Man 1 \nIsrael 1 \nItalia 1 \nItaly 20 \nJapan 3 \nMalaysia 5 \nMexico 9\nNetherlands 3 \nNew Zealand 2 \nNorthern Ireland 1 \nNorway 10 \nNZ 1 \nPanama 1 \nPortugal 1\nRussia 3 \nSacramento 1 \nScotland 3 \nSingapore 9\nSlovak Republic 1\nSlovenia 1\nSouth Africa 4\nSpain 9 \nSultanate of Oman 1 \nSweden 3 \nSwitzerland 14 \nTaiwan 3 \nThailand 2 \nThe Netherlands 8\nTunisia 1 \nTurkey 1 \nU.A.E 1 \nUK 51 \nUnited Arab Emirates 2 \nUnited Kingdom 24 \nUnited States 13 \nUnited States of America 25 \nUSA 176 \nVenezuela 2 \n\n\nSTRANGER DANGER\n===============\n\nAs you read this article, look around at your working environment. The\nitems/information you have to hand may not seem very sensitive because\nyou deal with them every day... but now look again.\n\nIf you were alone and not a member of staff, how would you view them?\nWhat would you find if you looked around? Picture yourself as a visitor\npassing through. What can you hear in terms of conversation? What can\nyou see?\n\nThe chances are that you can hear and see quite a lot that you would not\nwant to be openly disclosed to the outside world. If this is the case,\nthe security of your information is at risk potentially from every\nvisitor, stranger, subcontractor, etc. \n\nThis article is not written with the intention of discrediting visitors,\nbut nonetheless, it is important to be fully AWARE of what CAN happen if\ndue caution is not exercised.\n\nThe following guidelines may help in ensuring that the risks are\nminimized:\n\n* Your reception/visitor area should issue distinctive badges and ensure\nthat visitors wear them\n\n* Consider using different colored badges for each day of the week.\n\n* Challenge those who are not displaying any identity badges\n\n* If your location issues identity badges - make sure YOU wear yours\n\n* Do not be afraid to ask someone who they are visiting and what they\nare doing\n\n* Do not be lazy... escort visitors from reception (if applicable)...\ndon't let them make their way to you\n\n* Do not hold doors open for people not displaying their ID\n\n* Do not leave visitors alone   \n\n\n\nISO17799 - MORE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n==========================================\n\n1) How many controls are there in the standard?\nPart 1 is organized into 10 sections. There are 127 main controls and\nover 500 detailed controls in total.\n\n2) What is part 2?\nPart 2 basically explains how to apply the standard itself, and how to\nbuild and operate an information security management system.\n\n3) How old is it?\nThe standard stems from an original publication in 1993, from the DTI in\nthe UK. It became BS7799 in 1995 and of course ISO17799 in 2000.\n\n4) What is accreditation?\nAn accreditation body can authorize others to \"certify\" third parties\nunder the standard (p2). A number of accreditation bodies exist in\ndifferent countries.\n\n5) Is certification for life?\nNo. It is normally for three year periods.\n\n6) ISO17799 is used throughout the world, but was it internationally\ncreated? Yes indeed. The latest versions included input from\nrepresentatives from many nations, including Australia, Brazil, Germany,\nNorway, UK and USA, amongst others.\n\n7) Is it linked to a specific national legal system?\nNo. It is generic in terms of legislation.\n\n\n\nCREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS: MINIMIZE THE RISKS\n============================================\n\nThe use of credit and debit cards to purchase goods and services has\nbecome an everyday convenience that we take for granted, but there are\nassociated information security risks which we should pause to consider,\nespecially when making payments over the Internet.  \n\nWeb sites are becoming an increasingly popular means of purchasing goods\nand services, but they have also become popular targets for cyber\ncriminals, who often use stolen credit card numbers to purchase goods,\nwhich can then be easily exchanged for cash.  There are also relatively\nsimple technologies now readily available which could be used by hackers\nto surreptitiously steal vast amounts of money, a few pounds at a time,\nfrom millions of people. A survey by the IT research company Gartner\n(http://www.gartner.com) predicted that Internet crime involving the\n\"mass victimization\" of consumers could take place by the end of this\nyear.  \n\nWe recommend the following best practice guidelines to minimize the\nrisks involved in credit card transactions:\n\n* Ensure that credit cards used to purchase goods or services on the\nInternet have a low credit limit, or if debit cards are used, that they\nhave limited funds and are only topped up to cover specific Internet\npurchases.\n\n* All expenses incurred through Internet transactions should be\ncarefully audited on a regular basis for any anomalies.\n\n* Only enter credit card details on a Web site if you are confident as\nto its authenticity and that the connection is secure - the prefix https\n(as opposed to the usual http) in the Web Site address indicates a\nsecure connection.\n\n* If the security of a Web site is in doubt, any confidential\ninformation posted to it may be exposed to malicious intent.  Be\nextremely cautious when posting confidential details on any site where\nthe Internet Service Provider hosting the site is not verified. Note\nthat we have pre-checked all sites referenced in this newsletter for\nsecurity!\n\n* If ordering by telephone using a credit card, ensure that you are\ntalking to the correct person.  If you are unsure whether the\norganization you are dealing with will handle your details sensitively,\npay by some other means.\n\n* Lost or stolen credit card details may be used for Internet\ntransactions.  Inform the card issuer and relevant person within your\norganization immediately if a company credit card is lost or stolen.\n\n\n\nBSI - CERTIFICATIONS\n====================\n\nCongratulations to all the following who have been certified by BSI with\nrespect to BS7799 Part2 for at least one system in at least one\nlocation:\n\n7 Global, Accordis Acetate Chemicals Limited, Alenia Marconi Systems\nLtd, American Society of Quality, AMOUN Pharmaceutical Co (Egypt),\nAttenda Limited, Business Coach IT Management, CADWEB Limited, Camelot\nGroup Plc, Capita Business Services, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Limited, DBI\nConsulting, Digex, DNP Facility Services Co Limited (Japan), Ericsson\nESPA A S.A., Glaxo Wellcome Manufacturing (Singapore),GlaxoSmithKline,\nHanvit Bank Korea, Hyundai Information Technology, Icfox International,\nIntergalis, Logic Systems Management, Macquarie Corporate\nTelecommunications Pty Limited Australia, Netstore Plc, NTT Data Corp,\nParamount Computer Systems (UAE), PCCW Business eSolutions Hong Kong,\nS-Cube Inc, Serious Fraud Office, Siemens Business Services Trust Center\n(Munich), Stiki EHF (Iceland), Sony Bank Inc (Japan), Co-operative Bank\nPlc, The University of Texas, Total Network Solutions Limited, Unisys\nLimited, Vodafone Telecommerce GMBH, Volex Group Plc\n\n\nWe intend to produce a more complete list in a future newsletter. We\nwill also include certificates issued by the growing number of other\ncertification bodies across the world.\n\n\n\nISO17799 SECTION 11: BCP REVIEW \n===============================\n\nBusiness continuity planning is covered by section 11 of the standard, a\ncore requirement of which is the creation and maintenance of a business\ncontinuity plan.\n\nCreating such a plan from scratch is a difficult undertaking of course.\nThis is one reason why software products were produced. Unfortunately\nthese often become problematic in themselves... difficult to learn,\nexpensive, etc.\n\nRecent times have therefore seen a move to simplification, with\norganizations keen to avoid adding complexity to an already complex\ntask. At the vanguard of this change was a product developed entirely in\nMS-Word: The BCP Generator.\n\nThis was designed from top down to simplify business continuity\nplanning. It comprises two components: a plan template and an\ninteractive guide (the latter using Word macros to jump to and fro into\nthe correct part of the template). It's impact upon the business\ncontinuity scene has been substantial, with organizations from the very\nlargest to the smallest embracing the tool and its concepts. It is in\nactive use in over 40 countries.\n  \nWith this change of emphasis in the business continuity planning market,\nthere is now NO excuse for not creating a full recovery plan. The old\nlines of \"too expensive\" and \"too difficult\" are now less hollow than\nthey ever were. Although section 11 is very clear with respect to the\nneed of a comprehensive plan, it is surely also a matter of due\ndiligence to have one, and equally, irresponsibility not to have one.\n\nFor information on the BCP Generator see: \nhttp://www.disaster-recovery-plan.com\n\nFor information on business continuity generally, see:\nhttp://www.yourwindow.to/business-continuity/ \n\n\n\nIT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE....COULD IT?\n====================================\n\nEvery issue of The ISO17799 Newsletter features at least one TRUE story\nof an information security breach and its consequences. Again, in this\nissue, we focus upon 'low tech' but high impact incidents:\n\n\n1) On 25th October a contract programmer who had once worked for a large\nUS based bank walked into the 'inner sanctum' of the main building (the\nsecurity guards remembered him as someone permitted to do so). In the\ndealing room he claimed to be conducting a quality audit and\ninterrogated a junior employee and watched a program run - noting down\nsecurity codes as they were entered. He then left and hung around\noutside until just after normal trading time.\n\nHe then rang the Bank from a public phone box and initiated an\nelectronic funds transfer using the codes... $10.2m to a Swiss account. \n\nThe plan nearly failed when he found that he had noted one of the codes\nincorrectly, but he rang the Bank department back and incredibly managed\nto trick a different employee into revealing the correct digit.\n\nHe flew to Switzerland and later returned with the money. He was caught\nsimply because he couldn't resist boasting about his great feat. When\nthe police contacted the bank they were still totally unaware of their\nloss!\n\n\n2) Remote, or dial-in access can be a real Achilles heel if not properly\ncontrolled. In a recent case a young hacker gained access to a major\ncompany's system by using the default password of a system engineer\n(which had never been changed!). \n\nThis gave him considerable scope and powers of access. To cover for\nhimself, however, he semi-disabled the machine log, changed a number of\nuser passwords, created several fictitious privileged users and tampered\nwith the dial back system.\n\nGetting more ambitious he established a communication link with another\ncomputer and ended up making it crash. All this took place over a couple\nof evenings.\n\nTo recover from the havoc the installation had to close down its prime\ncomputer and restore from the previous weeks back-up, at considerable\ncost.\n\n\n3) Over a period of nine months, the number of computer malfunctions\nwithin a large company had risen from an average of two per year to\ncritical levels. The impact was such that the business fell behind with\nits invoicing systems and had to buy processing and backup from third\nparties. As it could not deliver some of its services reliably, it\nstarted to lose the confidence of its customers. The situation began to\nspiral. \n\nEventually, the company suspected foul play may be involved and called\nthe police. Secret surveillance equipment was installed to monitor\nstaff. One was filmed lightly scratching circuit boards in disk units\nand also attaching paper clips to them. Both these actions led to a\nshort circuit.\n\nWhen confronted, he confessed everything. His motive was to earn\novertime, which was required to process the overlap work which was\ndelayed by the malfunction. He netted 689 UKP over the 9 months. The\ncompany lost at least 500,000 UKP.   \n\n\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS \n=============\nHave you got something to say on the topic of ISO17799... a fresh\ninsight or some information which might benefit others?
