Feedback, notes and comments\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nMACHINIMA  My reputation for small errors continues to grow (I am\nkeeping quiet about the big ones) with a misprint in last week's\npiece on this word. In the sentence giving the etymology, of all\nplaces, I misspelled it \"mechanima\", thus confusing everybody.\n\nAPPETITE OVER TIN CUP  Several replies came in about this saying,\nconfirming that variations on it and other ways of saying \"head\nover heels\" are widely known, especially \"ass over appetite\" from\nthe US, where \"appetite\" may be a transferred term for the mouth.\nBut the specific form that Maria Jessup Robinson was asking about,\n\"appetite over tin cup\", seems not to be known much at all. It\nwould seem to be a conflation of the British expression \"arse over\nteakettle\" and the American \"ass over appetite\" (note my deliberate\nuse of the two spellings of \"arse\" here!). The saying was probably\nmodified because at the time it was created a tea kettle was an\nitem less common in America than in Britain. Even in Britain these\ndays it is obsolete as a fixed term except within this expression,\nwhich itself is now not very common.\n\nBUMBERSHOOT  Several subscribers have pointed out that the word is\nin the lyric of a song sung by Dick Van Dyke in the film \"Chitty\nChitty Bang Bang\":\n\n  Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo\n  You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo\n  You can have me hat or me bumbershoot\n  But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo\n\nIt may be one reason why some Americans, not familiar with the word\nin their own country, have come to believe it must be British.\n\nOLOGIES AND ISMS  The publication date of my book has been moved\nback a week in the UK to 29 August. A review by Jonathon Green is\nscheduled for the issue of 31 August (assuming nobody changes the\ndate again). See <http://www.worldwidewords.org/ologies.htm> for\nmore details and UK ordering information.\n\n\n2. Turns of Phrase: Asian Brown Cloud\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs though we didn't have enough to worry about weather-wise, what\nwith global warming, the ozone hole, and the new El Ni�o season,\nUN scientists have now identified this new threat to the world's\nclimate. It is a cloud of smog three kilometres deep, enveloping\nthe whole of southern Asia - a soup of industrial pollutants,\ncarbon monoxide from vehicle exhausts and particles of soot from\nburning forests and millions of rural cooking fires. It blocks 15%\nof sunlight, which reduces crop yields. It also creates acid rain,\nleads to respiratory illnesses, reduces rainfall and causes extreme\nweather events. Because the cloud is capable of being dispersed\nrapidly around the world, it may affect a much wider area than just\nAsia. The term \"Asian Brown Cloud\" seems to have been around for a\ncouple of years in scientific circles, but came to prominence this\nweek in a report prepared by a team of international climatologists\nat the UN Environment Programme in preparation for the World Summit\non Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next week. The good\nnews, they say, is that unlike other causes of pollution and\nclimate change, this one is curable if Asians can shift to more\nefficient ways of burning fuels.\n\nThe \"Asian Brown Cloud,\" a 2-mile-thick blanket of pollution over\nSouth Asia, may be causing the premature deaths of half a million\npeople in India each year, deadly flooding in some areas and\ndrought in others, a new U.N.-sponsored study indicates.\n                                   [\"Los Angeles Times\", Aug. 2002]\n\nA UN-backed study released on Friday said the \"Asian Brown Cloud\" -\na vast haze of pollution stretching across South Asia - is damaging\nagriculture, modifying rainfall patterns and endangering the\npopulation.\n                                [\"Agence France Presse\", Aug. 2002]\n\n\n3. Weird Words: Pyknic  /'pIknIk/\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nShort and fat.\n\nNothing to do with al-fresco meals, though it is said the same way\nas \"picnic\".\n\nIn the early years of the twentieth century the German psychiatrist\nErnst Kretschmer examined criminals to try to tie their physical\nshape and constitution to their personalities and mental illnesses.\nTall and thin ones he called \"asthenic\" (or \"leptosomic\") and\nconsidered them to be the sort that commits fraud and petty theft.\nA second set were athletic types with well-developed muscles, whom\nhe concluded, unsurprisingly, were more likely to be violent. The\nthird sort were the \"pyknic\" ones, who seemed to be a mixture of\nthe other two kinds so far as their criminal tendencies were\nconcerned. He took \"pyknic\" from Greek \"puknos\", thick or close-\npacked; it appeared first in his book \"K�rperbau und Charakter\"\n(Physique and Character) in 1921, from where it soon moved into\nEnglish.\n\nThe American psychologist William Sheldon built on and modified\nKretschmer's ideas, coming up with the three terms to describe body\ntypes - \"endomorph\", \"mesomorph\" and \"ectomorph\" - that are now\nmore common. He considered Kretschmer's pyknic type to be a mixture\nof the endomorph (with a soft round body tending to put on fat, the\nSanta Claus type) and the mesomorph (with a compact, powerful, and\nathletic body tending to the Tarzan or Mr Universe type) and came\nup with the phrase \"pyknic practical joke\" to describe a person who\nis muscular in early life but who later goes pear-shaped and\nballoons out into obesity.\n\n\n4. Q&A\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ. A friend and I were reading a recent article in the \"New York\nTimes\" that made mention of a \"mash note\". I had never heard this\nterm before, but I extrapolated that it is some sort of love note.\nIs there a more specific meaning than a simple love note? And can\nyou give some insight as to the origin of the term? [Jane\nRosenthal, California]\n\nA. You're right about the meaning of the phrase.\n\nWe have to go back some way to find the origin. The first form was\nthe word \"mash\" by itself. This was a slang term in the US in the\n1870s for an infatuation or crush (a magazine in 1877 defined it as\n\"a deep but fleeting affection of the heart\"). A \"mash\" could also\nbe a dandy or the object of one's affection (of either sex) or - as\na verb - to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sex,\nto flirt or seduce. A \"masher\" was a man who thought himself\nirresistible to the female sex but whose advances were often\nunwelcome.\n\nThe evidence collected by Professor Lighter in the \"Random House\nHistorical Dictionary of American Slang\" and by others suggests\nthat it was originally a term used in and around the theatre.\nCharles Godfrey Leland (best known for his \"Hans Breitmann�s\nBallads\" about a German immigrant) wrote a note above his poem,\n\"The Masher\", dated about 1895, confirming this:\n\n  The word to \"mash,\" in the sense of causing love or\n  attracting by a glance or fascinating look, came into\n  ordinary slang from the American stage. Thus an actress\n  was often fined for \"mashing\" or smiling at men in the\n  audience.\n\n\"Mash\" and its derivatives crossed the Atlantic to Britain about\n1880. \"Masher\" in particular became a term in London society,\nespecially among the more raffish supper-club and theatre-going\nclasses, for a type of fashionable male. The Oxford English\nDictionary defines it (with a distinctly maidenly air of drawing\naway its collective skirts) as \"a fop of affected manners and\nexaggerated style of dress who frequented music-halls and\nfashionable promenades and who posed as a 'lady-killer'\", noting\nthat the word had been common \"in 1882 and for a few years after\".\nIn a letter from London in the old \"Overland Monthly and Out West\nMagazine\" in 1889, a correspondent described a member of an\nimpoverished theatrical company: \"This dashing youth was distinctly\nconscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed beside\nus, and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances that\nsuperbly took them in would be a lesson for champion 'mashers' of a\nfar higher class\".\n\nA \"mash note\" (in its first appearances, \"mash letter\") was an\nobvious enough extension: a love letter. It is recorded first in\n1880 and - as you have discovered - is still doing well.\n\nWhere \"mash\" and its relatives come from has been a subject of\ndebate. It is sometimes said that it is from the standard English\nword meaning to make soft by one of various means, with its obvious\nreference to rendering the object of one's attentions pliable and\nyielding. Max Beerbohm, writing in London in 1894 (mashers were\nstill around then, despite the OED's comment) remarked that some\npeople derived it from \"Ma Ch�re\", \"the mode of address used by the\ngilded youth to the barmaids of the period\". But he thought it\nreally came from \"the chorus of a song, which, at that time, had a\ngreat vogue in the music-halls: 'I'm the slashing, dashing, mashing\nMontmorency of the day.'\" We're pretty sure now that he was wrong,\nbut he could hardly know that.\n\nBack to Charles Leland again. Apart from his humorous writings, he\nalso researched and wrote a great deal about the Romany language as\nwell as Gypsy songs and customs. The following note from the\nintroduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widely\naccepted:\n\n  It was introduced by the well-known gypsy family of actors,\n  C., among whom Romany was habitually spoken. The word\n  \"masher\" or \"mash\" means in that tongue to allure, delude,\n  or entice. It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by\n  its quasi-identity with the English word. But there can be\n  no doubt as to the gypsy origin of \"mash\" as used on the\n  stage. I am indebted for this information to the late well-\n  known impresario Palmer of New York, and I made a note of\n  it years before the term had become at all popular.\n\nThough defunct in British English, \"mash\" and \"masher\" have never\nquite gone away in America. \"Mash\" had a resurgence of popularity\nas student slang in the 1980s in the sense of necking or petting,\nthough that may be a back-formation from \"mash note\".\n\n\n5. Endnote\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"A Spanish lady asked an acquaintance during a visit to Ireland\nwhether there was a word in his language similar to 'mana�a'. The\nIrishman thought for a moment, then said: 'Sure there is, but it\ndoesn't have the same sense of urgency.'\" [Traditional Irish joke.]\n\n\nA.
