But what this graphic editor will do is make quick\n   work of creating short QuickTime movies and animated GIFs--\n   and for OS X freeware, it doesn't get much better than that.\n   Cartoon Editor lets you draw or import JPEGs and GIFs, which\n   you can then manipulate with a set of tools that lets you\n   group, scale, duplicate, ghost, and all sorts of other useful\n   cartoony things. The program's Java2D foundation allows for\n   some surprisingly powerful features, like gradients,\n   antialiasing, splining, and transparencies.\n\n   http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=6b-8g5ZIHEcOAstO5H80ywQ-4d0P6cR \n\n   Want to review Cartoon Editor?
