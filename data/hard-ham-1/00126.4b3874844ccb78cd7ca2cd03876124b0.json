You said \"that was great, but you only told half the story\". You wanted to know two more things:\n<ol>\n<li>How to make the FTP Server available to Internet users\n<li>How to secure the FTP Server\n</ol>\nThere are several ways to make an FTP server on the internal network available to users on the Internet. These methods are referred to as \"Server Publishing\". You can use a Windows XP computer running Internet Connection Services (ICS) to publish a server on your internal network.\n<p>\nLet's take a look at a common scenario. You have a Windows XP computer connected to the Internet with an always-on cable or DSL connection. You have another computer on your private network also running Windows XP. You've installed the FTP Server on this internal network computer and put files into the FTP folder. Now you want Internet users to connect to the FTP Server through the ICS computer directly connected to the Internet.\n<p>\nYou can do this with the Windows XP ICS! Here's how:\n<ol>\n<li>Go into the Network Connections window. You can get there from the Network applet in the Control Panel.\n<li>Right click the network interface directly connected to the Internet and click Properties.\n<li>Click on the Advanced tab in the connection's Properties dialog box. Put a checkmark in the Internet Connection Firewall checkbox. Always make sure the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled when you connect a computer directly to the Internet.\n<li>Click the Settings button, then click on the Services tab in the Advanced Settings dialog box.\n<li>Now click the Add button. This brings up the Service Settings dialog box. Type in My FTP Server in the Description of service text box. In the Name or IP address text box, type in the IP address of the computer on your private network that's running the FTP server. Since you're using ICS, it'll have an IP address like 192.168.0.x, where x is different for each machine on your network. You might want to manually assign the IP address the FTP Server already has, so that it doesn't change in the future. You can find out what IP address your FTP server is using by opening a command prompt at the FTP server and typing in the command ipconfig. That will give you the IP address the FTP Server is using. Back to the Service Settings dialog box, select the TCP option button. For the External Port and the Internet port, put in the port number you assigned to the FTP server on your internal network. Read this week's How To section to see how to change the listening port number. Clic!\nk OK\n<li>Click OK, and then click OK one more time! You might need to disable and enable the adapter after making the change. You can do that by right clicking the always-on interface.\n</ol>\nThe procedure is very similar for dial-up connections. However, there are problems with dial-up connections (and many always-on connections) because the IP address on the external interface of the ICS computer changes over time. Next week I'll share with you a cool way you can get around this problem by using something called a \"dynamic DNS service\". I've used one for years, and it works great. Make sure to tune in next week for the details.\n<p>\nThere you have it. Is server publishing in your future? Have any questions on the method I described above? If so, let me know! There are lots of ways you can publish services. Tell me how you do it, and tricks you've learned along the way. If you're having problems with server publishing, let me know about those too! I'll be sure to include what I learn from you in upcoming newsletters.\n<p>\nUntil next week,<br>\nTom Shinder, Editor<br>\n(email us with feedback: <a href=\"mailto:feedback@winxpnews.com?subject=WinXPnews Issue #33\">feedback@winxpnews.com</a>)\n</font>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td background='http://www.winxpnews.com/graphics/h_border.gif' align=left>\n<img src='http://www.winxpnews.com/graphics/winxpnews_logo_50.jpg' width='53' height='24' align='right'>\n<font face='verdana, sans-serif' size='4' color='#ffffff'>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;SPONSOR: Is Your PC Spying On You?<br>\n</font>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><font size='1'>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709S2-PestPatrol&mid=9665862091709486\" target=\"_top\">\n<img src='http://www.winxpnews.com/ads/pestpatrol.gif' align='right' border='0'>\n</a>\n<font face='verdana, sans-serif' size=2>\nYou are surfing the Web.

If so, here's a tip Richard Surry sent in on how to fix the problem:\n<ol>\n<li>Open your Network Connections window from the start menu.\n<li>Right click on your modem (or other dial-up connection) and click Properties.\n<li>Click on the Advanced tab. You already have a checkmark in the box that enables the ICF. Click on the Settings button.\n<li>Click on the Services tab, then click on the Add button in the Services tab.\n<li>That should open the Service Settings dialog box. In the Description box, put in Internet Time Service. For the Name or IP address of the computer hosting this service on your network, type in 127.0.0.1. Select the TCP  protocol option button. For both the external and internal port numbers, type 123.\n<li>If you're online, disconnect and reconnect. Now synchronize the time by double click on the clock in the system tray and going to the Internet Time tab.\n</ol>\nThis is an interesting tip, and it represents an even more interesting problem. For you network geeks out there, I'll ask you this question: Why should we allow unsolicited inbound connections for the Internet Time Service? The ICF should not block responses to solicited outbound connections, so why should we have to enable reverse NAT to make this work?\n</font>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td background='http://www.winxpnews.com/graphics/h_border.gif' align=left>\n<img src='http://www.winxpnews.com/graphics/winxpnews_logo_50.jpg' width='53' height='24' align='right'>\n<font face='verdana, sans-serif' size='4' color='#ffffff'>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;HOW TO'S: ALL THE NEW XP FEATURES<br>\n</font>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><font size='1'>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<font face='verdana, sans-serif' size='2'>\n<p><font size=3><b>How to Secure an FTP Server on Windows XP Professional</b></font><p>\nLast week we went over how to install the Windows XP FTP Server. It will work fine after going through the steps outlined last week, but several of you asked for more information on how to secure the FTP Server because you wanted to connect it to the Internet. It's a very good idea to understand how FTP security works before putting the server on the Internet. Here are some suggestions:\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Internet Information Services console from the Administrative Tools menu. In the left pane of the console, expand your server name and then expand the FTP Sites node.\n<li>Right click on the Default FTP Site and click the Properties command.\n<li>Click on the FTP Site tab. Notice that the default TCP Port is set to 21. This is the well-known port for FTP. You can increase security a bit by changing this port to another value that's in the 1026-65534 range. This secures it from poorly motivated click-kiddies and also allows you to get around your ISP blocking incoming connections to TCP port 21. Friends who connect to your FTP server will need to change the port number on their FTP client software as well.\n<li>The Windows XP FTP server has a hard coded limit of 10 simultaneous connections. You might want to change this to a lower number to reduce the chance of a LAN party on the external interface of the FTP server.\n<li>Put a checkmark in the Enable Logging checkbox. Click the Properties button to the right of the log format drop-down list box. Click the Daily option button on the General Properties tab. On the Extended Properties tab, select all of the Extended Properties. Click OK.\n<li>Click on the Security Accounts tab. Place a checkmark in the Allow only anonymous connections checkbox. This prevents users from sending username and password credentials to the FTP server. You don't want users to send credentials because those credentials are sent in \"clear text\", which can be read by anyone who's listening on the wire.\n<li>Click the Messages tab. Enter a Welcome message, an Exit message, and a message users will see if there are no available connections.\n<li>Click on the Home Directory tab. Make sure there is a checkmark in the Read and Log Visits checkboxes. REMOVE the checkmark in the Write checkbox. Note the location in the Local Path text box. Navigate to that path in the Windows Explorer.\n<li>Right click on the FTPROOT folder and click Properties.\n<li>Click on the Security tab. Make sure that SYSTEM has Full Control. Assign the IUSR_<computername> account READ access only. Remove all other permissions for the IUSR account. Make sure you give Adminstrators Full Control tool. This allows you, the administrator on the FTP Server computer, to add, remove and change files in the FTPROOT folder.\n</ol>\nStop and restart the FTP Server. Now your FTP server is secure and Internet bad guys won't be able to use it to distribute porno and bootlegged software.\n</font>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td background='http://www.winxpnews.com/graphics/h_border.gif' align=left>\n<img src='http://www.winxpnews.com/graphics/winxpnews_logo_50.jpg' width='53' height='24' align='right'>\n<font face='verdana, sans-serif' size='4' color='#ffffff'>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;WINXP SECURITY: UPDATES & PATCHES<br>\n</font>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><font size='1'>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<font face='verdana, sans-serif' size='2'>\n<p><font size=3><b>Cumulative Patch for Windows Media Player</b></font><p>\nI think it was a couple months ago when I wrote about some serious problems with the Windows Media Player (WMP).
