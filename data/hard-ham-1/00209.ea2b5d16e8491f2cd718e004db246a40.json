More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial\noffice suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's\nearnings.\n\nUnited Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal\n<radhika.lal@undp.org>, a Information-Communication Technology Policy\nAdvisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for\nE-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18.\n\ninfoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington\nUniversity, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to\ndraw participants from local, national and international organizations from\nboth the public and private sector.\n\nThis meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness\nabout the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More\nimportantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors,\nusers and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source,\ne-Government and related fields.\n\nMs Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for\nDevelopment Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York.\n\nICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet\nfor global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy.\nBut despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world,\nso far little networking has been done between these two separate circles.\n\nSee http://www.egovos.org/\n\nOTHER ARMS OF THE U.N.\n======================\n\nBesides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be\nshowing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source\ntools. \n\nParis-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and\nCultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. \n\nIt's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft.\n\nUNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin <jc.dauphin@unesco.org> of the Information\nSociety Division also announced that this international organisation has\nbeen looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software\nmovement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science\nand culture.\n\nIt zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called\nthe 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for \"revising,\nupdating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal\" as well as for\nincluding new basic documents. \n\n\"This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can\nbe discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,\"\nsaid Dauphin. \n\nCheck out the sites at\n\nUNESCO Libraries Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_bib/)\nUNESCO Archives Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_archives/)\nUNESCO Free Software Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/)\nUNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/)\n\nNEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS\n======================\n\nRecently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange\nfrom and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and\nIsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and\nto UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. \n\nCDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is\nfreely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within\nthe Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code\n(GPL license). \n\nSee http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtml\n\nMeanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme)\nbased in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously\nabout organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and\nrelated issues.\n\n\"We want to see how we can further this cause in the region,\" APDIP's Shahid\nAkhtar told this correspondent.\n\nNiranjan Rajani <niranjan.rajani@maailma.net>, of Pakistani origin but based\nin the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on\n\"Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries\".\n\nThis project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has\nundertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for\nMaailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net.\n\nThis project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use\nof FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects;\nGNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World\ncountries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies\nand lives of these countries.\n\nCONVINCING GOVERNMENTS\n======================\n\nIn India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick\npresentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. \n\nShift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's\nthe message that governments across India were recently with, as official\ncomputerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and\nspeedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence.\n\nSenior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in\nattentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing\ngiant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long\nlists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way.\n\nPointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US\nDepartment of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are\nmaking Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in\nvarsities, military installations and within government. \n\nSome months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information\nTechnology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre\nof India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems\nsupplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the\ngovernment sector.\n\nOn networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for\nDevelopment), issues of free software and open source often make it to the\nnews.\n\nGNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed\nout. (See http://www.lincproject.org)\n\n\"The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare\nLaw Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access\nto the Internet and use technology more effectively,\" says Dirk Slater\n<dirk@welfarelaw.org>. \n\nWhile these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one\nanother and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle\nremains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. \n\nDespite many \"digital divide\" initiatives addressing access to the Internet\nin low-income communities, access is still an issue. \n\nPublic Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not\nsufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have\naccess to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their\nhomes. \n\nLINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great\nfor rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent\nface-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints.\n\n\"We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that\nworks well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to\ndiscontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95<\naccording to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income\nNetworking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center.\n\nLINC protagonists say they had also been \"troubled\" by the frequent problems\nthat occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. \"Giving\na person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed\nlike we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar\nprojects but had limited success,\" says Slater. \n\nLINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using\ndonated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led\norganizations that LINC serves. \n\n\"Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use\nopen-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to\ndocument the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide\ndetails of our experiences for others doing similar projects,\" LINC\nexplains.\n\nLINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and\ninstalled GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in\npeople's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone\ncomputer to work as the main computer in the GRO office.\n\nLinks were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local\nsupport.\n\n\"We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely\nsuccessful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether\nthe board members are actually using the computers to communicate more\neffectively,\" said Slater.\n\nTo view the daily journals on the project with GRO please visit the LINC\nProject Linux pages at <http://www.lincproject.org/toolkit/linux>\n\nNEED TO NETWORK\n===============\n\nBala Pillai <bala@tamil.net>, who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in\nSydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an\norganisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the\nimpact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World.\n\nSays Pillai: \"The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time\nzone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino\npsyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. \n\n\"Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more\ntime diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it.\nFilipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to\nmore symbiosis with them,\" says he. \n\nPillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted\nwith since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community.\n\"http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key\nOpen Source catalysts in the Philippines,\" says he. \n\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is\nanother lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. \"Do look\nfor symbiosis opportunities there too,\" he suggests. \n\n\"I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is\nlikely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or\npublicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and\nfound out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this\nwork and get fruits out faster,\" he adds.\n--\nFrederick Noronha * Freelance Journalist * Goa * India 832.409490 / 409783\nBYTESFORALL www.bytesforall.org  * GNU-LINUX http://linuxinindia.pitas.com\nEmail fred@bytesforall.org * Mobile +9822 122436 (Goa) * Saligao Goa India\nWriting with a difference... on what makes *the* difference\n\n\n##########################################################################\n# Send submissions for comp.os.linux.announce to: cola@stump.algebra.com #\n# PLEASE remember a short description of the software and the LOCATION.  #\n# This group is archived at http://stump.algebra.com/~cola/              #\n##########################################################################\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nFrom: Frederick Noronha <fred@bytesforall.org>\nSubject: Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative]\nDate: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMT\n\nDear friends,\n\nCan we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source\nSoftware initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to\nsupport their cash-strapped initiatives? \n\nSarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study\nof Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.\n\nJeebesh Bagchi <jeebesh@sarai.net> sent in this offer recently.
