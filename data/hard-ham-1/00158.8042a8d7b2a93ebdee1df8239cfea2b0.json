These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with\ncurrent events surrounding the companies you hold.\n\nNotice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing\nWall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one\nreason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly\ndon't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.\n\nSure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have\nsignificantly more access to business management than we ever\nwill as individual investors, so they can have some valuable\ninsights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of\ncompany trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond\nmarket (more on this later). \"Strong buy?\" Pfffffft.\n\nIn this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is\nslipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly\nvalued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large\nshare price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple\nof 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is\npriced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple\ncompany are much more likely to be traumatized if its business\nstarts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows,\nwhatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular,\nit's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a\ncompany that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.\n\nSo let's look at a few instances where companies have started to\ngo wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning\nsigns of an impending stock collapse before it happens.\n\nWARNING SIGN 1: SLOWING SALES GROWTH\nThrough 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of\nthe fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best\ncapitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the\nmarket: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted\nrevenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April\n2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the\nnext quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E)\ncompany, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in\na row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a\nbarnburner like Nokia, one is enough.\n\nSome words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest\nsectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they\nalways do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then\ncanals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If\nyou're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and\nthey don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell\ntrigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give\na company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on\nthe second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a\nyear-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a\nyear-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly\ngrowth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew\nsequential growth.)\n\nWARNING SIGN 2: DIVERGENT SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH\nBy April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs\nwere surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies\ngrowing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom\nlines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales\nwere growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end\nof the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70%\nto 40%.\n\nProfits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to\ncollapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics\nchanged quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock\nreacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the\ntechnology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see\nsigns that something was wrong.\n\nWARNING SIGN 3: PLUMMETING CASH FLOWS\nIn 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings\nperspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look\nat two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free\ncash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have\nsignificant capital investment demands, but low operating cash\nflow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999,\nLucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion,\nbased upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the\nworld, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications\nequipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690057\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690058\n\nBut as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were\nafoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an\noperating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost\n$276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in\nreported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than\n$2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference\nbetween Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating\ncash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3\nbillion, and not in a good way.\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690059\n\nThe investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have\nsaved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999,\nLucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but\ntwice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow\nis reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.)\n\nAnd get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on\nEnron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they\nweren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.\n\nWARNING SIGN 4: WATCH THOSE BONDS\nRemember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's\nbecause their information can be quite conflicted, and it's\nalmost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best\ninterests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the\nsame type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.\n\nBondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally\npaid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the\ncurrent price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds\nbondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I\nrecommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of\nthe bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders\nare growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same\ntime analysts are shouting, \"Strong buy!\"\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690060\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690061\n\nI recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company\nand get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity\nbetween five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced\nat 100 is at \"par,\" which means that the bond's face-value\ninterest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some\nbonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be\nlower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk.\nBut some are priced below face value, even way below.\nhttp://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690062\n\nAs of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at\n18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance\nthey'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent\nproblems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with\n2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not\none that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports\na price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than\nTyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they\ndon't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.\n\nWARNING SIGN 5: \"IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER\"\nFor a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the\nlargest company in the world by market capitalization. This\nshould have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the\nstock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion\nimplied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach\n$34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings\nhigher than $12 billion in a single year.\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690063\n\nAs it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco --\nit has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that\narticle. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any\nbetter achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no\nsigns of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000,\nCisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8\nbillion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of\n53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then\n66% higher.\n\nOnly Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine\na $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for\nfuture growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the\nmidst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As\ninvestors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities.\nTaking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this\npoint, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business\nwas fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot\nhas to be right for the situation to work out.\n\nHOMEWORK\nFor this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after\nLesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you\nlooked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company,\ndo the following:\n\n- Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four\n  quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating,\n  staying about the same, or weakening?\n\n- Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past\n  four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing\n  slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?\n\n- Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past\n  three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net\n  income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look\n  at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around\n  due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much\n  more indicative of real cash flow trends.)\n\n- If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center\n  and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know\n  whether your company has any debt, just type your company name\n  into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)\n  http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690064\n\n- Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its\n  current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is\n  there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario\n  already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market,\n  this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's\n  still a question you should consider.)\n\nTo help you out, we've put together the Foolish Stock Information\nForm to track all of your research and information about your\nstocks.

Well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.</P>\n<P></P>\n<P>Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I recommend keeping a <A href=\"http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690017\">log sheet</A> where you write down the price of the bond. <A href=\"http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690018\">Download it here</A>. If you see a drop, the bondholders are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same time analysts are shouting, \"Strong buy!\"</P>\n<P></P>\n<P>I recommend the <A href=\"http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690019\">Yahoo! Bond Center</A>. You can search on any company and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced at 100 is at \"par,\" which means that the bond's face-value interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk. But some are priced below face value, even <EM>way</EM> below.</P>\n<P></P>\n<P>As of this writing, <STRONG>WorldCom</STRONG> (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid. <STRONG>Tyco</STRONG> (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default. <STRONG>Qwest</STRONG> (NYSE: Q) sports a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.</P>\n<P></P>\n<P><STRONG>Warning sign 5: \"It just doesn't get any better\"</STRONG> <BR>For a brief time in 2000, <STRONG>Cisco Systems</STRONG> (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the largest company in the world by market capitalization. This should have been a warning. <A href=\"http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690020\">As I wrote</A> in May 2000 when the stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach $34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had <EM>ever</EM> generated earnings higher than $12 billion in a single year.</P>\n<P></P>\n<P>As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco -- it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000, Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8 billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of 53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then 66% higher.</P>\n<P></P>\n<P>Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities. Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot has to be right for the situation to work out.</P>\n<P></P>\n<P><STRONG>Homework<BR></STRONG>For this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company, do the following:</P>\n<P></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating, staying about the same, or weakening?\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much more indicative of real cash flow trends.)\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>If your company has long-term debt, go the <A href=\"http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690021\">Yahoo! Bond Center</A> and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know whether your company has any debt, just type your company name into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market, this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's still a question you should consider.) </LI></UL>\n<P></P>\n<P>To help you out, we've put together the <STRONG>Foolish Stock Information Form</STRONG> to track all of your research and information about your stocks.
