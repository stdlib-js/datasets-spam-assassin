They are deployed in a cellular \nfashion, and provide extended security, management and roaming.\nOn the other hand, the Home Gateways allow a single cell to be connected to \na WAN, like a modem, a cable modem or a DSL access. The set of features is \nquite different, and they offer NAT/masquerading and PPP configuration.\n\nThe conventional Ethernet bridging method (promiscuous sniffing) doesn't \nwork with most wireless LAN standard, because of the header encapsulation \nand the interactions with link layer retransmissions. In other word, most \noften, when you use a software bridge on a wireless LAN (such as the Linux \nbridge on a 802.11 card), it doesn't work (moreover, quite often promiscuous \nis broken as well). \"\n\n[[ What the?? What is he talking about?? Aren't we all using Linux to bridge \nour networks? ]]\n\n\" The driver could work around this restriction by creating its own MAC \nheaders (802.11 headers instead of 802.3, and putting the right bits in the \nright place), but in fact most vendors don't provide the specification on \nhow to this with their hardware (when they don't explicitely prevent it in \nhardware, to force you to buy their Access Points).\n\nIn other words, don't expect to use your Linux PC as a wireless bridge or \nwireless Access Points with most products out there, and forget about \nturning it into an Access Point. Of course, there is some exceptions. \"\n\n[[ Is this true? ]]\n\n\n\" The workaround is to set the wireless LAN in ad-hoc mode and to use other \nmethods, such as routing, masquerading, IP bridging, ARP proxying... \"\n\n\n[[ Yes, I am in a process of building a wireless-lan <-> wired-lan bridge. \nBut I don't understand what this guy is talking about. Anyone?\n\n\nVince. ]]\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \nhttp://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\n\n\nTo unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@wireless.org.au\nwith \"unsubscribe melbwireless\" in the body of the message\n\n\n"}
