She was my\nfather's older sister, though I only knew her through a few e-mail\nexchanges and a couple of brief encounters as a child. This news\ncame hours after I received ANOTHER bit of disturbing news:\n\"Please tell Chris that one of his first fans died last weekend of\na heart attack at home.\" I first met Jon Snyder at an Apple user's\ngroup meeting a couple of years ago; to me, he always looked like\na beefier Robert Beltran. Death is something we all must deal\nwith, but you never seem to be prepared for it when someone\nactually dies. A few months ago, Aunt Theresa sent word that she\nhad seen my show. It was good to know that even though we hadn't\ninteracted much over the past few years, she was still able to see\nme on TV. And even though you didn't know him, you're closer to\nJon than you realize. Witness this message he sent to his boss a\nfew months ago:\n\n<p>\n\n<I>\"I evangelized for months last year for having our company at\nthe first of these consumer computer conferences in Des Moines\nlast October, but got shot down. The conference was a hit despite\nbeing postponed by 9/11, and having to move the venue at the last\nminute. I know... I was there. So, I'm starting all over again\nbeing 'pushy' about our presence at this event in August of this\nyear. Chris Pirillo, whose Des Moines-based commercial email\npublishing group 'Lockergnome' puts this conference together, is a\nfriend of mine. He was the 'kid' hired by TechTV to host their\nCall for Help daily TV program in SF starting last fall. If you\nget the Dish network or Mediacom cable you can catch his show. I\nhave my DishPlayer set up to record his show on a daily basis.\nIt's VERY well done, as is TechTV as a whole.\"</I>\n\n<p>\n\nI returned from speaking to another <a href=\"http://www.dvpc.org/\">user group</a> the other night and\nfound that approximately 100 new GnomeTomes had been ordered.\nSweet! When I started looking closer at the numbers, I realized\nthat Jake was offering his <a href=\"http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/cat_audio.html\">Converting\nVinyl LPs to CD</a> eBook for free - and that's all anybody was\ntaking. No, seriously - five hundred orders later, and 99% of them\nwere just for that particular title. Now, while I don't have a\nproblem with Jake's offer, I do want to encourage you to check out\nthe non-free titles (and if you've already looked, please\n<a href=\"http://www.gnometomes.com/\">look again</a>). A lot of blood,\nsweat, and tears went into them - and they're just as helpful. In\nfact, Jake's also written one for <A HREF=\"http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001924.html\">OS X</A> (which\nprobably wouldn't impress you if you weren't using an Apple\nmachine). Although, I'm sure plenty of you use\n<a href=\"http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.html\">Dreamweaver</a>.\nWhich reminds me: Jake's also now authoring our Webmaster Weekly\nnewsletter. So, if you haven't read that in a while, I'd encourage\nyou to give it another glance. After all, as <A HREF=\"http://members.aol.com/voicepro/\">Elwood\nEdwards</A> so finely said: <a href=\"http://www.lockergnome.com/coolstuff/youvegotlockergnome.mp3\">You've\nGot Lockergnome</a>!

And every time, it has resulted in\nincreased sales. The best-known example, of course, was the\nadvances in tape cassette technology in the 60s and 70s, including\nDolby sound technology. As with MP3, this technology was opposed\nby the music industry as different from previous such\ndevelopments, because it made it possible for ordinary people to\ncreate their own copies at near-professional quality. The actual\nresult was the creation of a whole new profit center for the music\nindustry - pre-recorded cassette tapes - which actually became\nmore popular than vinyl for a while (before the advent of CD\ntechnology).\n<P>\nThe thing is, the music industry is well aware of this effect -\n and they are not really aiming to stop the private exchange of\nsongs in MP3 format. If that were their goal, they'd be\ninstituting widespread, aggressive legal actions against all the\nserver-centered nodes (as they did against all radio stations\nplaying their music in the 30s, when they really thought the\nphenomenon was going to wipe them out). Instead, they have focused\non the best-known services - first Napster, then Morpheus, KaZaA,\nand most recently, Audiogalaxy. Even in those cases, they've\nlimited their legal challenges to things they know they can win -\n and they've avoided actual court trials whenever possible (to\navoid the possibility of setting some damaging precedent).\n<P>\nThe point that seems to escape a lot of people is that copyright\nis not a property in the same sense as most of the things we think\nof as property. One key difference is that if you don't defend it,\nyou lose it. If you left your car sitting in the driveway, with\nthe window open and the keys in the ignition, and somebody drove\naway in it, that would still be theft - and you'd still be\nentitled to get your car back. Not so with copyright. If you are\naware of infringement and you do nothing to try to stop it, you\nare voluntarily allowing it to enter the public domain. It's for\nthe same reason that big companies insist that newspapers put a\ncopyright or trademark symbol after the names of their products\nwhenever they're mentioned, and not use words like &quot;Coke&quot; or\n&quot;Kleenex&quot; as generic terms. They don't really expect everybody to\ndo what they say - and they're well aware that having the name of\none's product become the generic term for a product is actually a\ngreat marketing boon. But if they DON'T do that, someone at some\npoint could start using the word on their own product, arguing\nthat it is in the public domain.\n<P>\nThe efforts of the music industry are not aimed at actually\nstopping the exchange of music between individuals - which they\nknow from long experience, increases their sales because most of\nthe people who normally buy the music aren't really satisfied with\nnear-perfect copies. For most of them, the learning curve and the\ncost in time of creating those copies themselves outweighs the\ncost of simply buying the CD. Most of the outright piracy is\ncommitted by people who wouldn't have bought the music in the\nfirst place. What the music industry is doing is clearly aimed at\nestablishing a public record of their efforts to defend copyright,\nin the broadest, most public way; to prevent anyone from making a\nlegal claim that the stuff they own has entered the public domain.\nThe thing they're really worried about, in terms of profits, is\nthe change in the marketing model. Even legitimate online music\ncommerce threatens the album format, with its traditional mix of a\nfew good songs and a bunch of others most people wouldn't pay for\nif they were buying the stuff song by song. The problem is how to\nmake as much money on a per-song basis - and, at the moment, it\nrequires charging far more for an individual song that most people\nare willing to pay.\n<P>\nAt any rate, copyright is actually a fairly complex matter of\ncivil law, with a good deal of history behind it - dating back to\nthe Renaissance. The strategies music companies use are clearly\ndirected to realities and necessities, in light of history and\ncase law. They have also done a great PR job, convincing the most\ntechnically knowledgeable people on the Internet that it is a\nsimple moral or criminal issue. &quot;Common sense&quot; tells a lot of\npeople that copying music without paying for it is just like\nstealing someone's car, and represents a loss to the owner. But if\ncommon sense could decide the issue equitably, we wouldn't have\nthe law in the first place. Most of our great intellectual\nsystems, including not only law but science, are designed in large\npart to overcome the errors of common sense, and that is more the\ncase in civil law than criminal. The people who work within those\nsystems are well aware of that, but they are also well aware that\nmost people aren't - and that it can work to their advantage. Any\ntime a highly paid civil attorney begins by telling you that an\nissue vital to his client is actually very simple, or just a\nmatter of common sense, there's a very high probability that what\nhe means is that it's to his clients advantage if people like you\nbelieve that. If it really WERE that simple, the client wouldn't\nbe paying him as much as he is.\n\n\n<!-- FAVORITE -->\n<p align=\"right\"><a class=\"url\" style=\"color: gray; text-decoration: none\" href=\"http://www.lockergnome.com/submit.html\">Submit Your Thoughts</a> <font class=\"url\" color=\"gray\">|</font> <a class=\"url\" style=\"color: gray; text-decoration: none\" href=\"http://www.lockergnome.com/recommend.html\">Recommend It!</a></p>\n\n\n<p class=\"sidebar\"><table cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\"><tr><td><font style=\"font-size: 10pt\" face=\"Verdana, Tahoma, Arial\" size=\"2\">\n<b>A BOOK FOR EVERY GEEK:</b> Want to know more about <a href=\"http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001826.html\">networking</a>?

Lockergnomie Wayne\nSmith: &quot;Here is a bit of information specifically for Hotmail\nusers who may have trouble opening your links, due to the service\nwanting to place the referred URL in a separate frame. I receive\nmy Lockergnome newsletters via Hotmail and find it really useful\nwhen you folks include the link as text. However, sometimes this\nisn't practical - or it stops the flow of the article. The trouble\nhere is that the link sometimes returns the message: 'There was an\nerror displaying this link' in the frame. No problem! Right-click,\ncopy shortcut, paste to metapad (freeware from LIQUIDNINJA.COM),\nthen do a global search and replace. The trick is to replace the\ncontrol codes with the correct characters: %26 is an ampersand;\n%3a is a colon; %2e is a period; %20 is a blank space; %2f is a\nforward slash; %3d is an equals symbol; %3f is a question mark.\nThe Windows character map can help with any others. Select a\ncharacter, look at the status bar, replace 'U+[code]' with the\npercent sign. In other words, the ampersand (U+0026) is %26 which\ntranslastes into a '&amp;' symbol. Maybe a more clever Gnomie can come\nup with some script which we can place in the 'Web' folder,\ncorrectly register, and use in IE's right-click / context menu?&quot;\n\n\n<!-- ADMINISTRIVIA -->\n<p align=\"right\"><a class=\"url\" style=\"color: gray; text-decoration: none\" href=\"http://www.lockergnome.com/recommend.html\">Recommend It!</a></p>\n\n<p><br><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\"><tr><td><p class=\"sidebar\">\n<table cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\"><tr><td>\n<font style=\"font-size: 8pt\" face=\"Verdana, Tahoma, Arial\" size=\"1\">\n<a href=\"http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/daily/20020712.html\">http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/daily/20020712.html</a>\n<p>Your subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@spamassassin.taint.org] - To unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the <A HREF=\"http://www.lockergnome.com/changesub.html\">subscription management</A> page.
