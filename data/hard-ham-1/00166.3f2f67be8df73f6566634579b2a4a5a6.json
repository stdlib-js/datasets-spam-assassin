If you would prefer \nnot to receive messages of this type, please \nunsubscribe by following the instructions at the \nbottom of this message.\n\nDear Fool,\n\nJust before Enron plunged...\n\n...16 of 17 Wall Street analysts were still urging you \nto buy Enron's stock.  While the company piled up debt \nand manufactured imaginary earnings, auditors gave the \nbalance sheet a big thumbs-up.  As investors lost \neverything, Enron insiders pocketed millions.\n\nAND THAT should make every investor's blood boil!\n\nFrankly, the Enrons and Global Crossings of the world \ninfuriate me.  All the backroom manipulations dirty \ndealing and cover-ups really make it hard to know who \nyou can trust.   And that is why we've created a NEW \ninvesting service, \"David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool \nStock Advisor\" -- to bring the Motley Fool co-founders' \nextraordinary commitment to honest stock analysis, \nfair dealing and complete disclosure to investors like \nyou on a regular and timely basis.\n\nThe Motley Fool, which David and Tom founded back in \n1993, is dedicated to the principle that given the \nright tools...the average guy can find great success in \nevery aspect of his financial life.\n\nAnd now, David and Tom are applying this principle -- and \ntheir extensive investing experience -- to the new \n\"Motley Fool Stock Advisor.\"  \n\nBut as you'll see, this service isn't just about \n\"buying more stocks.\"  OUR GOAL in publishing the \n\"Motley Fool Stock Advisor\" is twofold:  To help you \ngain the knowledge, confidence and resolve to make \nmoney in the U.S. stock market...while avoiding the \nbiggest mistakes, as well.\n\nThe Wall Street analysts touting Global Crossing said \nits worldwide fiber-optics network would make it the \nking of telecom.  Now these shares are WORTH NOTHING.  \nMicrostrategy was the poster child of the technology \nbubble-after earnings restatements, the stock now sits \n99% OFF its high!  Kmart's lousy inventory management \nand marketing incompetence helped drive the company \ninto BANKRUPTCY.\n\nWHAT ABOUT Nortel and Lucent-two of America's most \nwidely owned stocks.  Will they ever come back?  How \nabout AOL?  Does its merger with Time-Warner mean the \nGLORY DAYS are over -- or have they just begun?   Are 90% \nof all telecommunications companies truly in danger of \ndisappearing? If so, which will survive? Will great \nold names like JP Morgan, Disney and Motorola recover?  \n\nWell, those are the sorts of questions David & Tom \nGardner can help you answer at the \"Motley Fool Stock \nAdvisor.\"  \n\nAs they say, \"Show us the money.\"  When it comes to \nmaking promises, fast-talkers can fudge just about \nanything.  But CASH FLOW doesn't lie.\n\nYOU CAN avoid a lot of big mistakes by simply making \nsure a company has the cash coming in to pay its \nbills.  And watching cash flow is also one of the best \nways to identify superstar companies -- far more reliable \nthan \"earnings\" that can be manipulated 8 ways to \nSunday.  Once you eliminate big losers from the \nequation -- and target the true superstars -- you'll find \ninvesting more fun...less stressful...and much more \nprofitable, as well.\n\nSo forget about Wall Street's \"damaged goods\"-\ncompanies that have a boatload of debt and accounting \nwoes, as well.  Keep it SIMPLE instead.\n\n\"Simple\" means investing in companies that we all -- with \na little effort -- can understand.  Companies where we \nknow what businesses they're really in.  Companies \nwhere the financial statements actually mean \nsomething.  And companies easily recognizable as the \n\"best of breed.\"\n\nIn the free report you received, \"The One Stock That \nKeeps Wall Street BUZZING,\" you read about one of \nDavid & Tom's very favorite investments: Starbucks.  \nBefore this company came along, most folks just took \ncoffee for granted.  And certainly, no one proposed \nany far-reaching business model built around it.  Yet \nthese innovators took a low-margin commodity and built \na near $3 BILLION company with more than 5000 \nretail outfits all around the world.\n\nStarbucks has been able to open new outlets based on \nmoney it has earned from existing ones. That is an \nastounding testament to its economic power.  At The \nMotley Fool Stock Advisor we'll help you find and \ntruly understand the great investments, the companies \nwith solid balance sheets and real growth prospects.   \nRight now we're following companies such as:\n\n*America's most prestigious jeweler -- its brand name \nhas no rival.  With net margins of 59% on sales of \n$1.6 Billion, this company is a great pick for solid \nreturns with low risk.   \n\n*This software company commands more than 25% of the \nvideo game market.  Its shares have returned 6,000% \nsince its public debut in 1989.  An investment of \n$5,000 in 1989 is now worth over $300,000.  The video \ngame market is expected to double by 2005 with this \ncompany enjoying the lion's share of the growth.\n\n*This premier credit rating company has locked-in \ndemand for its reports on the creditworthiness of \nborrowers holding $30 trillion of the world's debt.  \nIt has a 20-year record of consistent sales and income \ngrowth and is poised for another stellar year.\n\nYOU CAN TRY the \"Motley Fool Stock Advisor\" for six \nfull months 100% RISK-FREE.

Do you like BIG PROFITS?  In 1994, investment \npros sniffed at America Online's high-flying stock and \nscreamed, \"Overvalued.\"  But the Gardners saw three \nthings they overlooked: 1) AOL was building the \npremier stop in cyberspace; 2) They had a great \nretention strategy; and 3) Millions of members paying \n$$$ every month.\n\nSo Tom and David bought it.  And today they're sitting \non whopping 4,120% gains.  So you see, while they do \nstructure their investing strategy to avoid big \nblunders...they do make a lot of money, too.
