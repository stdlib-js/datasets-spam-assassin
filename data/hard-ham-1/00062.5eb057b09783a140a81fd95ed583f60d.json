REVIEW</b><br>\nThe Entire Tech Week in a Single Email<br>\nSaturday, July 13, 2002<p>\n<b>If you've ever taped a \"Seinfeld\" episode or traded music online, Uncle =\nSam may want you--to stop.</b>\n\n<p>\n\nDraft legislation that is winding its way through Congress would sharply li=\nmit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows and transf=\nerring files through the Internet. The first part of their proposal, which =\nwould <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D8b-SBGBQY0y2oGDikAEY=\nIEElDh4B1FR\" >limit backup copies</a>, has drawn objections from academics =\nand nonprofit groups that have reviewed it.\n\n<p>\n\nUnder current copyright law, Americans who record a TV program or radio seg=\nment generally may \"sell or otherwise dispose of\" that analog recording or =\ndigital file as they wish.\n\n<p>\n\nThe proposed bill would end that exemption, handing copyright owners substa=\nntial new control over the distribution of their works by curtailing a cons=\numer's right to copy material under a doctrine known as \"fair use.\"\n\n<p>\n\nAnother salvo in the copyright battle was delivered when a federal judge sa=\nid that record labels and film studios could <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.on=\nline.com/Click?q=3Da0-11h8QQBqNNjxwbcUByjw2PB1s79R\" >expand an ongoing copy=\nright lawsuit</a> to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popula=\nr Kazaa software.\n\n<p>\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Associ=\nation of America last October sued three prominent file-swapping companies =\nin Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Net=\nworks, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally=\n created the Kazaa software.\n\n<p>\n\nHowever, in February, Kazaa BV sold the Kazaa file-swapping software to Sha=\nrman, a company later revealed to be based in Vanuatu, a small island in th=\ne South Pacific. The recording and movie industry trade groups asked permis=\nsion to add that company to the lawsuit in June. A judge ruled this week th=\nat Sharman could be added to the lawsuit.\n\n<p>\n\n<b><font color=3D\"#CC0000\">Shoring up U.S. security </font></b><br>\n\nComputer security is becoming <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=\nq=3Db5-50FcQ7U79NyMUQi1PHq15ZNEEZuR\" >increasingly critical</a> to Presiden=\nt Bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally pro=\nposed the department last month, he never mentioned the Internet or so-call=\ned cybersecurity.\n\n <p>\n\nBut as Capitol Hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting abou=\nt tech-savvy terrorists--and insisting any new agency must shield the Unite=\nd States from electronic attacks as well. House Republicans have asked comm=\nittees for any suggested changes to the White House-backed bill by the end =\nof the week.\n\n<p>\n\nIncluded in the proposal are radical changes for the U.S. government's Inte=\nrnet defenses. The plan would stitch together nearly all computer protectio=\nn functions, from the Commerce Department's Critical Infrastructure Assuran=\nce Office to the Computer Security Division of the National Institute of St=\nandards and Technology to the Federal Computer Incident Response Center.\n\n<p>\n\nAdditionally, the proposed department is likely to get its own <a href=3D\"h=\nttp://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3Dca-iciuQUgF71gRVXMcl8jfOfRHHUsR\" >priv=\nacy czar</a>. A draft of the legislation seen by CNET News.com states that =\nthe Secretary of Homeland Security must appoint a privacy officer to ensure=\n that new technologies \"sustain and do not erode\" privacy protections and t=\no verify that the agency's massive databases operate within federal guideli=\nnes.\n\n<p>\n\n<b><font color=3D\"#CC0000\">Who's running your computer? </font></b><br>\n\n\n\nPerhaps a more immediate security concern to individuals is what is going o=\nn now with their computers.\n\n<p>\n\n\n\nApple Computer OS X users could let hackers <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.onl=\nine.com/Click?q=3Ddf-1kJhQLEFh2TGWRjfbQq-Kh1XhaZR\" >piggyback malicious cod=\ne</a> on downloads from the company's SoftwareUpdate service.  According to=\n the BugTraq mailing list, a hacker named Russell Harding has posted full i=\nnstructions for how to fool Apple's SoftwareUpdate feature to allow a hacke=\nr to install a backdoor on any Mac running OS X.\n\n<p>\n\nThe exploit takes advantage of SoftwareUpdate, Apple's software updating me=\nchanism in OS X, which checks weekly for new updates from the company. Acco=\nrding to Harding, who claims to have discovered the exploit, the feature do=\nwnloads updates over the Web with no authentication and installs them on a =\nsystem. So far, there are no patches available for this problem.\n\n<p>\n\nUsers of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Outlook and Outlook Express applica=\ntions <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3Df5-lTbRQgwxlE6ooZY6D=\nmLwgkaZmRuR\" >may be vulnerable</a> to a recently discovered software flaw =\nthat could leave their system open to malicious code carried on Web pages o=\nr in e-mails. A security researcher and partner at risk-assessment company =\nPivX Solutions warned that HTML objects embedded in Web pages and e-mail co=\nuld carry code that allows an attacker to check out victims' cookie files, =\nread their documents and execute programs on their computer.\n\n<p>\n\nStill another problem is plaguing Outlook: A popular plug-in that lets user=\ns encrypt and digitally sign messages has <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.onlin=\ne.com/Click?q=3D0a-ZnKCIrrs-4R73PWBwhq6GOxuYzsR\" >inadvertently weakened</a=\n> security and left the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye =\nDigital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associ=\nates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerab=\nility in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a vic=\ntim's computer.\n\n<p>\n\n<b><font color=3D\"#CC0000\">Wi-Fi everywhere, but not everyone</font></b><br=\n>\n\nOne of the first cameras that can shuttle photos and videos using the Wi-Fi=\n wireless networking technology has made its <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.on=\nline.com/Click?q=3D1f-rvwqI58wtiBX5xU1xmYgHobjqmZR\" >debut</a>. IQinVision =\nplans to sell the camera to companies such as security firms that need to p=\nut video cameras in places where wires can't go, or as a way to quickly ins=\ntall a temporary security system.\n\n<p>\n\nThis product is among the first devices to combine digital videography and =\nwireless LANs (local area networks) that use the Wi-Fi, or 802.11b, standar=\nd. Expect more digital camera makers to follow suit. The number of digital =\ncameras has been on the rise, and it's only a matter of time before a camer=\na maker wants to add a popular new technology like Wi-Fi.\n\n<p>\n\nWi-Fi is also <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D34-pJpSIcd8l=\nd53rX23_tvVyn4IcgdR\" >invading handheld devices</a>. Wireless equipment mak=\ner Intersil is working with SyChip to incorporate 802.11b wireless networki=\nng technology into a Secure Digital (SD) card for handheld devices. The car=\nd, which should be available to manufacturers for testing in the fourth qua=\nrter, lets handheld owners add and remove wireless networking capabilities =\nto handhelds that contain an SD slot from Palm, Hewlett-Packard and other c=\nompanies.\n\n<p>\n\nWireless SD cards would make it far easier for handheld manufacturers and o=\nwners to get these devices linked. Only a few handhelds include wireless ca=\npabilities, and they are some of the most expensive on the market. With the=\n card, wireless access becomes an option for many.\n\n<p>\n\nNot everyone is pleased with the explosion in popularity of wireless networ=\nking. Broadband providers are <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=\nq=3D49-ZM4cIEpSm4ht0v3VX4RVXFO5JSrR\" >cracking down</a> on some customers, =\nthreatening to cut service to those who set up the inexpensive wireless sys=\ntems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.\n\n<p>\n\nAfter being introduced just a couple of years ago, so-called Wi-Fi \"hot spo=\nts\" that tap into cable or digital subscriber lines (DSL) are now in at lea=\nst 15 million homes and offices. The problem is that one paying subscriber =\ncan set up a local network that allows several other people to access the N=\net, for fun or for profit.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<b><font color=3D\"#CC0000\">News.com special focus: China</font></b><br>\n\n\n\nAs China's society changes and its education system matures, the country is=\n becoming a major consumer and producer of computer products.
