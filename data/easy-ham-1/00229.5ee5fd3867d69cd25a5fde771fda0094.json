Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced\nthe object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home\nin Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.\nBut while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied\nacademic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl\nis adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.\nSiobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation � that the\nodd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.\nBut on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed � because\nit was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury.\n\"I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble\nsurface,\" she said.\nAfter closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on\nthe Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check\nthe object for authenticity.\nIf it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for\nauction.\nShe added: \"If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself\nfor sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite.\"\nBut Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of\nacademic caution.\n\"Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece\nof extraterrestrial rock,\" he said.\n\"They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions\nand cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt\naround the edge.\n\"Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the\nsmallest that they usually appear.\"\nTo establish the provenance of Siobhan's suspected meteorite it would have\nto be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it\nbeing extra-terrestrial are slim.\n\"Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the size\nof the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite.\n\"However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,\"\nhe added. \n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
