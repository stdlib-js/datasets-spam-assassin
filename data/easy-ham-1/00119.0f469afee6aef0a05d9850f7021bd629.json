It's unforgivable. The distress he's\ncaused the families is unacceptable.\"\nYoude has been released on unconditional bail until November 7 when he will\nbe sentenced.\nThe hearing has been adjourned for pre-sentence reports although the\ndefendant has been warned custody is an option.\nStory filed: 12:36 Monday 7th October 2002\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
