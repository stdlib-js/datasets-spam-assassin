If the GA could handle this sort of thing so they'd\nautomatically be zeroed, I'd feel better since the ranges could change\nnext time the phrase list is regenerated or the algorithm tweaked.\n\nI think we need to understand why DATE_IN_PAST_48_96 is so low before\nwe remove it.  The two rules on either side perform quite well.\n\n>> And here are the rules that seem like they should be better or should\n>> be recoverable:\n\n>>>   FROM_MISSING\n>>>   GAPPY_TEXT\n>>>   INVALID_MSGID\n>>>   MIME_NULL_BLOCK\n>>>   SUBJ_MISSING\n\n> well, I don't like SUBJ_MISSING, I reckon there's a world of mails from\n> cron jobs (e.g.) which hit it.\n\nOkay, drop SUBJ_MISSING.\n\n> But, yes, the others for sure should be recoverable, and I'm sure there's\n> more.\n\nProbably a few, those seemed like the best prospects to me.\n\n> BTW do you agree with the proposed methodology (ie. remove the rules and\n> bugzilla each one?)\n\nI only want a bugzilla ticket for each one if people are okay with\nquick WONTFIX closes on the ones deemed unworthy of recovery.\n\nIf you could put the stats for each rule in the ticket somehow (should\nbe automatable with email at the very least), it would help.\n\nDan\n\n\n"}
