According\nto the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,\nshoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.\nThe figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of\nanthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the\nUniversity of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit\npeople's shape.\nThe volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the\ninner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below\nthe buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.\nIt has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)\ntaller than his French counterpart.\nThe mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men\nonly the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height\nadvantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.\nThe average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared\nwith 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and\n1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and\nAmericans 1,626.7mm\nMore disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other\nnationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men\nand 66.7 for women.\nThe average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7\ninches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and\n806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of\n1,047.2mm.\nThe average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second\nlargest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably\nsmaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.\nThe average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than\nthe French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the\nSwedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively\noutstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.\nHowever Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm\ncompared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,\ncompared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.\nThe DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the\navailable evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm\nlonger than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American\naverage.\nThe British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German\ncounterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.\nBeverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for\noccupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.\nThe department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to\nopen ring pull cans.\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
