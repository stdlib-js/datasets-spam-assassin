Please try an experiment:  train on 550 of each, and test once\nagainst the other 550 of each.  Do that a few times making a random split\neach time (it won't be long until you discover why directories of individual\nfiles are a lot easier to work -- e.g., random.shuffle() makes this kind of\nthing trivial for me).\n\n"}
