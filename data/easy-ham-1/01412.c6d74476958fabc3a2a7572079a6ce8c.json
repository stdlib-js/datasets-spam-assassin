But, in all probability: no, it isn't usually worth it. So, it\ncomes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker's job.\n\nIf the product requires occasional authentication, simple copying\nwon't work; the product has to be cracked. In which case, the issue is\nwhether you're actually going to enter into battle with the crackers,\nor just make sure that it isn't trivial.\n\nA lot of it comes down to your customer base. Teenage kids tend to be\nmore concerned about cost and less concerned about viruses/trojans,\nand so more willing to use warez. Fortune-500 corporations are likely\nto view matters differently.\n\n> Does it really make it more secure ?\n\nYes; software techniques will only get you so far. Actually, the same\nis ultimately true for hardware, but cracking hardware is likely to\nrequire resources other than just labour.\n\nAlmost (?) anything can be reverse engineered. But it may be possible\nto ensure that doing so is uneconomical.\n\n> Look at the DVDs.\n\nIIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; and\none where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.\n\n-- \nGlynn Clements <glynn.clements@virgin.net>\n\n"}
