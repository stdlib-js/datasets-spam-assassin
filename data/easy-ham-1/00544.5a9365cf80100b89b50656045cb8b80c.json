Consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each\n>pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him \"Wilt\",\n>also has sex with the other 499,999 women\n\nThis has never happened.  Its relevance is nil.\n\n\n>Averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their \n>actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.\n\nSo I chose not to type \"on average\" explicitly in my post, since this\nis FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.\n\n\nThere is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested\nin typical behaviour and you in extreme.  Actually, you probably just\nhad a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.\n\n\nEOT, AFAIC.\n\nR\n\n\n"}
