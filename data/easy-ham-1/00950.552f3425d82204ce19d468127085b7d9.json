I measured the time spent wrapping the stuff in \nFtoc_Next with time {} so the data is for real. One difference \nbetween mine and Valdis' setup (judging from his trace) is that I use \nthe address book. I've been doing that for ages so that can't be the \nproblem.\n\nIs there a way to get the log to print time with higher granularity?\n\n/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n"}
