Rob \"Pringles Can\" Flickenger wrote \nit up. \n\nIt turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other \n\"promiscuous\" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same \ntime causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your \nsegment of the wireless network and respond to it with a \"rejected\" message. \n\nSo today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around \nand tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). \nAh, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress!
