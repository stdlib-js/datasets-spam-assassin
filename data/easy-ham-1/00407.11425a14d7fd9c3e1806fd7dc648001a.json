But you can recharge and discharge them \nvery quickly, and they take lots more of cycles than the best battery. \nIdeal for absorbing the braking energy and turn them into smoking tires \nfew moments or minutes afterwards.\n\n> the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run\n> anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.\n> 200 MPH should be no problem.\n\nI don't see any reason why EVs shouldn't dominate dragster runs. The\ntraction is the limiting factor, not motor power. You can basically put\nthe motors into wheelhubs mounted on a composite frame, and dump juice\ninto them until they melt, which will be some 100 sec downstream. Plenty\nof time to smoke anything.\n\nOf course, it doesn't roar, and spew smokage, so it won't happen.\n\n\n"}
