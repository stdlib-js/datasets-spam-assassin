We may come up\n  | with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another\n  | setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,\n  | that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that.\n\nI actually think you're looking in the wrong place.   I, at least,\nhave almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or\nselected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,\nwhich appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.\n\nThe problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)\nwhere it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be cleared\nwhen there's something else to replace it (even if the highlighting\nof what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom\napplication (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There\nnormally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary\nselection (that is, set it to be a null string).\n\nThen, because of the \"if I get asked for the selection value, I will\nfind something\" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert\npoint, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the\nPRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing\nelse has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from\neither the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was\ndeleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.\n\nThat behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.\n\nOnce that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal\n\"select stuff, click at new insert point, paste\" mode of operation\nthat almost everyone expects to work (whether the \"select stuff\"\nis somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).\n\nkre\n\nps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've never\nreally understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that\npart of the code and see how it all really operates.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n"}
