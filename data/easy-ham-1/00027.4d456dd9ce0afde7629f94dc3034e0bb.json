Added a second hard disk\nfor Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went\nfine except it didn't pick up my monitor.\n \nI have a Dell branded E151FPp 15\" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4\nTi4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default\nset. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.\nThen I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but\nit still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?\n \nAnother problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,\nthe whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is\ninactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.\n \nIf anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -\nI've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.\n \nOr should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions\nwelcome.\n \nThanks a lot,\nPeter\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
