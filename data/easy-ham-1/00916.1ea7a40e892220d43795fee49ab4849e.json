De Soto says that isn't\ncorrect.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,\nin fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise\nparticipate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.\n\n \n> > Mr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work.\n> \n> On the \"to find\" list.  Any chance of\n> an explanation of that \"Bell Jar\" in\n> the meantime?\n\nFrench historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)\n\n==>\n\nThe key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,\nwhich I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if\nin a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and\nconquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate\nof capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the\nwhole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly\nparadoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was\nnot ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent\ncountry residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...\nbetween the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence\nunder Lorenzo the Magnificent?\n \n\n--------------\n\nDe Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those\nwho have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do\nnot.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they\ndon't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital\nand allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged\nwith a small section of people who know them personally.\n\n[1] Actual poor people, not 'poor' Americans with a living standard that\nis the envy of most of the world.\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
