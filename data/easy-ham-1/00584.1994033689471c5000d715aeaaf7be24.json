Taking food from a small vendor in India and not paying them is\ntrying to starve them.\n\nIt sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of\nactivists.\n\nI'm rarely an apologist for Muslims anywhere.  Yet I find my sympathies\nwith the Muslims in this case, even after they burned the train.\n\n\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\n> Stephen D.
