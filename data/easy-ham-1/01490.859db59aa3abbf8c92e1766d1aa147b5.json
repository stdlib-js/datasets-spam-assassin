In 2.40 the scores\nwere evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie.\nthere was no \"blind\" testing, and the scores could overfit and still\nprovide good statistics.\n\nIn 2.42, they're evaluated \"blind\", on a totally unseen set of messages,\nso those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.\n\n--j.\n\n"}
