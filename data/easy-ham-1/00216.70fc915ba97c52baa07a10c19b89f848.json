I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me\nfriend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.\n\nSome expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of\nhaving to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to\nLinux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never have\nto go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).\n\nThanks a million.\nCarlos\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
