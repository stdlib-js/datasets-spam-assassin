The vast majority (all but, say, 10) have never\never existed.  Yet, spammers would semi-continuously connect, try to\ndeliver mail to 40 of them, disconnect, connect again, try delivering\nto 40 more...  over and over, they kept getting \"User unknown\" until I\ngot around to making them spamtraps.\n\nSo my evidence would suggest that it depends who you're dealing with. :)\nIf your \"business\" is to sell address lists to people who would then spam,\nit's in your best interest to never clean your list.  Therefore you can\nsay \"10 million email addresses\" and not technically be lying, even if\nthe majority of them don't work.\n\nIf you're a spammer, you'd want to know who doesn't actually exist, but\nthen again you don't really care: you probably want to relay through\nsomeone so it's harder to trace you, if you could you'd send to every\nemail address available, you don't want to setup a valid bounce address\nbecause again it's easy to trace you.\n\nSo I would say this, if you technically spam people but actually think\nyou're running a legit service, you probably really do have a way of\nopting out (even though the user didn't opt in) and you probably don't\nrelay, and you probably pay attention to bounces.\n\nEveryone else doesn't really care.\n\n\nThat's my view anyway. :)\n\n--=20\nRandomly Generated Tagline:\n\"Now you can do that thing with your hands...
