Java\nwill soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it),\nit's just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a\nfunction of age.\n\n> 4.

Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's\nworking!\n\n- Adam L. \"Duncan\" Beberg\n  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/\n  beberg@mithral.com\n\n\n"}
