It \nwas beautiful. Odd colors and light. Obviously we wondered what it was. Today \nJim explains it. (It was a rocket test from the Vandenburg air force base). \nVery neat. It was a bit too blurred out when I saw it, and there was too much \nstreet light to make a good photo, so I am happy to have found the photo from \nNASA...\n\n\n"}
