Messenger and IRC with a single\ninterface, despite some companies actively avoiding messenger\ninteroperability.\n\nAccording to Jason Ross, senior analyst at amr interactive, in June 2002\nthere were 28,000 home users of Trillian in Australia, about 0.4 percent\nof the Internet population, and 55,000 people using it at work, about 1.8\npercent of the Internet population.\n\nDavid Banes, regional manager of Symantec security response, told ZDNet\nAustralia the code appeared to be valid.\n\n\"With these sort of things you have to find some process that would\naccept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to\ncrash,\" he said. \"Once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit\nit.\"\n\nHe said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on\nNotepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system.\nHe said the problem was easy to fix by \"writing protective code around\nthat particular piece to more closely validate the data around that\npiece.\"\n\n\"Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the\nchecks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these\nbuffer overflows and exploits out there now,\" said Banes.\n\nCerulean Studios, creator of Trillian, was contacted for comment but had\nnot responded by the time of publication.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor all security-related news, including updates on the latest viruses,\nhacking exploits and patches, check out ZDNet UK's Security News Section.\n\nHave your say instantly, and see what others have said.
