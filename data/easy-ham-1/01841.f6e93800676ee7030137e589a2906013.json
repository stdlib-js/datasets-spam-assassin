I don't say that lightly. This evening he posted a note\n[1] on his weblog that he was giving up trying to get RDF to make sense inside \nRSS. As I read his essay I could feel two-plus years of exhaustion overwhelm \nme. I found myself writing a comment after his essay saying, among other things \n\"RSS is not a brilliant format. It is a compromise. It is for syndicating news \nfeeds. That's all it is for, for the 18,000th time.\" It's time for RDF to pack \nits bags and leave. RSS deserves some dignity, as does RDF. Emphatically, once \nand for all, they are not the same thing. Peace be with you RDF. Leave RSS \nalone. Thank you.\n\n[1] http://philringnalda.com/archives/002330.php\n\n\n"}
