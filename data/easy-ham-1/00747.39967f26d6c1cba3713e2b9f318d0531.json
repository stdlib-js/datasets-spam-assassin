Bison don't\nlive this high up.' \"\n\nKnapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,\nwhere scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a\nbison�one that died about 340 years ago. \"This was an extraordinary\ndiscovery,\" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it\ncould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. \"There's\nprobably a lot more like it yet to be found.\"\n\nAnd not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and\nsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru\nto Alaska�a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and\nindustry�have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As\nthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is\nemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep\nfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky\nfringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our\npredecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.\n\n\"It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through\nstudying these remains,\" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude\narchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic\nSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered\nin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old \"Ice\nMan,\" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have\noffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as\nthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional\ntreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.\n\nVanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother\nNature�and looters�take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can\ndeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're\noften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them\ndon't even realize they're ancient.\n\nThat was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in\nBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a\ndead animal. \"It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,\"\nrecalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. \"But when I looked\ncloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.\"\n\nFiguring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur\ntrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc\nbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed\nthe fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what\nseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter\nlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago\nPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who\nmay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human\nfrom the period ever found in North America.\n\nOther findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could\nexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the\nfirst place. \"Before this there was no archaeological record of people\nliving here,\" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. \"Now we\nsee that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.\"\n\nLike Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek\ncaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,\nGerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south\nYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in\ncaribou dung. \"It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been\ncaribou in the area for at least 100 years,\" recalls Kuzyk, then a\nwildlife biologist with the Yukon government.\n\nCaribou cake. Returning a week later, he found \"what looked like a\npencil with string wrapped around it.\" It turned out to be a\n4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the\nice patch�and scores of others around the region�revealed icy layer\ncakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800\nyears of changing hunting practices.\n\nScientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the\nice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.\nHunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded\nsome equipment in the ice. \"We've got people hunting with throwing darts\nup until 1,200 years ago,\" says Hare, who now oversees the research\nproject. \"Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about\n1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing\ndarts.\"\n\nNow scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They\nare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where\nglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to\nhave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell\nand St. Elias mountain ranges�the United States' most glaciated\nterrain�and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing\nEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as\nthe Ice Man. \"Global warming is providing us high-altitude\narchaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're\nprobably about the only ones happy about it.\"\n\n\n"}
