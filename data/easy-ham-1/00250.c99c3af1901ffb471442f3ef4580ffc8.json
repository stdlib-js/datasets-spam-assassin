Typically packages use /usr/local as default\n(so binaries might then go in /usr/local/bin, documentation in\n/usr/local/doc and so forth).\nNormally, I find it sufficient to put --prefix=/usr/local, and do not\nfurther specify things like --exec-prefix.\n\nMaybe you have a special reason for using the prefixes you chose, in\nwhich case ignore me!\n> That worked fine so I moved to the next step.\n> make\n> At the bottem of the text I got the following messages:\n> Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el\n> make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255\n> make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp'\n> make: *** [w3] Error 2\n> \n> When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.

I would use the command\n    ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local\n\nTo get w3 to compile, I think the with-url flag you should use is\n    --with-url=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/\n(Assuming you compiled/installed url with --prefix=/usr/local\nSince you appear to have installed url in /url/url, configure w3 with\n./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/ --with-url=/url/url/share/emacs/site-lisp\n\nA command you would have found useful would have been\n    find / -name 'url-vars.el' -print\nWhich would have told you where the url-vars.el file was installed.\n\nA program which is very useful is checkinstall\nhttp://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/\nIt allows you to install packages from source while still registering\nthem in the package management system of your distro (rpm,deb,tgz).\nInstead of \"make install\" type \"checkinstall\", and a package is put\ntogether and installed for you.  Makes uninstallation simpler than it\nmight otherwise be.\n-- \nMichael Conry   Ph.:+353-1-7161987, Web: http://www.acronymchile.com\nKey fingerprint = 5508 B563 6791 5C84 A947  CB01 997B 3598 09DE 502C\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
