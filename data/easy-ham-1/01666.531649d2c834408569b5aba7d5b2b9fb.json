Everyone receiving email via that server will contribute ham to the\n       stew, making the Bayesian classification less effective.\n\n    2. Given that there will be some false positives, you absolutely have to\n       put the mail somewhere.  You can't simply delete it.  (I also don't\n       like the TMDA-ish business of replying with a msg that says, \"here's\n       what you do to really get your message to me.\"  That puts an extra\n       burden on my correspondents.)  As an individual, I would prefer you\n       put spammish messages somewhere where I can review them, not an\n       anonymous sysadmin who I might not trust with my personal email\n       (nothing against you Greg ;-).\n\nI personally prefer to manage this stuff at the user agent level.  Bandwidth\nis a heck of a lot cheaper than my time.\n\nSkip\n"}
