We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the\nCold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We\ncelebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation\nof Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.\n\nTragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.\n\nEurope has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that\nHudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed \"progressive\ntransnationalism\". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist\nprogressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the\ndeconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of\ncitizenship (i.e. a \"global\" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and\nthe pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the\nUnited Nations.\n\nThe European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the\npooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there\nis a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected\nEuropean Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits\nto their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where\nelected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an\nappointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,\nwhose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,\nthe EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of\nthe people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired\nby the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice\nregularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member\ngovernments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.\n\nEuropean criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of\ncomplaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact\nthat our republican system of government is not based on proportional\nrepresentation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise\nthe fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy\nis so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear\n- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere\nin the world.\n\nOn August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent\nnewspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be\nrestrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade\nor so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it\nexaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because\nthe impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of\nthe US literally fantastic.\n\nAt least, for now.\n\nDespite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact\nremains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European\nintellectual and political elite.\n\nThe Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in\ncheck the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a\nsystem in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,\nhowever, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot\nunderstand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national\nsovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it\ndoes on compliance with international \"norms.\" They view all departures\nfrom such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal\nvote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the\nprocess is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble\nwith this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,\nauthoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic\nsocieties. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.\n\nThus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals\nto join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the\nliberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its\ndictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references\nto the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to\ncomply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,\ntherefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a\ncommitment to\nconstitutional rights.\n\nNone of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or\ncooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in\nfavor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while\ntheir tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a\npolitical atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably\nincrease.\n\nThat thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the\nthought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the\nnew ideology of transnational progressivism.\n\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR. A.
