(New York City).\n\nBill Bennetta\n_________________________________________________\n\n\"[M]ost pseudo-scientists have a number of characteristics in\ncommon.\n\n        \"First and most important of these traits is that cranks work\nin almost total isolation . . . in the sense of having no fruitful\ncontacts with fellow researchers. . . . The modern crank insists\nthat his isolation is not desired on his part.  It is due, he claims,\nto the prejudice of established scientific groups against new\nideas. . . .\n\n        \"The modern pseudo-scientist . . . stands entirely outside\nthe closely integrated channels through which new ideas are\nintroduced and evaluated.  He works in isolation.  He does not\nsend his findings to the recognized journals, or if he does, they\nare rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases\nare excellent.  In most cases, the crank is not well enough\ninformed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance\nto a significant study.  As a consequence, he finds himself\nexcluded the journals and societies, and almost universally\nignored by the competent workers in his field.  In fact, the\nreputable scientist does not even know of the crank's\nexistence unless his work is given widespread publicity through\nnon-academic channels, or unless the scientist makes a hobby\nof collecting crank literature.  The eccentric is forced, therefore,\nto tread a lonely way.  He speaks before organizations he\nhimself has founded, contributes to journals he himself may\nedit, and -- until recently -- publishes books only when he\nor his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed\nprivately.\n\n        \"A second characteristic of the pseudo scientist, which\ngreatly strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward\nparanoia. . . .\n\n        \"There are five ways in which the sincere pseudo-\nscientist's paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited.\n\n        \"(1) He considers himself a genius.\n\n        \"(2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, as\nignorant blockheads.  Everyone is out of step except himself.\nFrequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of\nstupidity, dishonesty, or other base motives.  If they ignore\nhim, he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable.\nIf they retaliate in kind, this strengthens his delusion that he\nis battling scoundrels. . . .\n\n        \"(3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated\nagainst. . . .\n\n        \"(4) He has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the\ngreatest scientists and the best established theories.  When\nNewton was the outstanding name in physics, eccentric works\nin that science were violently anti Newton.  Today, with\nEinstein the father symbol of authority, a crank theory of\nphysics is likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton. . . .\n\n        \"(5) He often has a tendency to write in a complex\njargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases he\nhimself has coined. . . .\"\n\n\n-- \nTerry W.
