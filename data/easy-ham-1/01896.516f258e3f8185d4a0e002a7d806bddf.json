Davis, I'd sieze every private pipeline, powerline, and \n    power plant and hold them hostage until the energy industry pays back every \n    dime they extorted from the state.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Stefan[3]!_)\n\n[1] http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-Natural-Gas-Prices.html\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/XmSAjzMJqcXB\n[3] http://www.io.com/~stefanj\n\n\n"}
