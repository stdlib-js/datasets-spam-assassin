You can only have a comment where\nTcl would expect to find a command.  Switch has a \"pattern - body\"\nstrucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find\na pattern, both of you will be confused with the results.  The\nsubtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines. I can't give you\nthe exact case, but I know exmh had one example that stopped parsing\ncorrectly, and was arguably wrong before.\n\n2nd - I've managed to remain fairly ignoranat of the PGP support in\nexmh, so you'll have to dig in yourself or see if someone else on\nexmh-users or exmh-workers is having similar problems.\n\n>>>Reg Clemens said:\n > > If you haven't already, you should enable the debug log under\n > > Hacking Support preferences and look for clues there.\n > > \n > > >>>Reg Clemens said:\n > >  > > Hi,\n > >  > > \n > >  > > On Sun, 01 Sep 2002 00:05:03 MDT Reg Clemens wrote: \n > >  > >   \n > >  > > [...]\n > >  > > > in messages with GnuPG signatures.
