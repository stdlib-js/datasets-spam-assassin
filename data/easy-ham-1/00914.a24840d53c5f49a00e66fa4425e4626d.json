Because I believe some of \ntoday�s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by \ncentralization.\n\nGenerically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one \nanswer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate \nagents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific \ncontext of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid \nvalue at a time. That limits us to only representing information A) \naccording to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more \nslowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the \nbasis for today�s most popular architectural style for developing \nnetwork applications: client-server interaction using request-response \ncommunication protocols.\n\nI believe these are profound limitations, which we are already \nencountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the \nbeholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the \nseparate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another, \nunfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a \ncentralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a \nthird example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as \nabstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these \nlimits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and \ncommunication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light \nand human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized \ninformation representation, and hence centralized software architecture.\n\n\n"}
