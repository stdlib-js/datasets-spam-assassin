Because was explicitly clear that the pro-Bush\nfolks went out and did the permit dance.   So where in the article is\nthis again?\n\nLets get something straight here.   This -is- a First Amendment issue.\nPublic streets, provided one isn't blocking traffic, generally tend to\nbe sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few\nyears ago (I'll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have\nchanged, and the specific facts in this case are weak).    IF this guy\n_was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all the\npro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong.  He certainly didn't do enough\nof a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge.\n\nI'll play with your perspective though.   Lets assume a few things.\nIf I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably\nassemble against Bush, do you think they'll give me a permit?\nProbably not.   So I lie.   Then the cop does what happened in this\nscenario.  HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I\nfalsified my statement to get this said document.   He arrests me.\nEnd of story.\n\nGAB> The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied\nGAB> nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting\nGAB> political rallies that you don't agree with has become\nGAB> common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled\nGAB> that there are some restrictions on the first amendment.\nGAB> They teach you that your very first year of law school.\n\nI'll agree with Owen on this one.  Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to\nchose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting\ndown has grown to become the answer because the government, over a\nspan of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the\nrights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.    If you\nquestion the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in\ngeneral, you're aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of\nthe folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're an\nanarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' miles\naway from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.\nI can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats\nspeech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting\nover the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other\nway.\n\n\n\n\nGAB> I think that given the information as laid out by the story,\nGAB> Mr. O'Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free\nGAB> speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost \nGAB> every American seems to involve the ability to communicate\nGAB> an idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directing\nGAB> a specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience\nGAB> that has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical \nGAB> effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person. \n\nGetting back to my original point.  How do you communicate  an idea to\nan unknown audience, if you're miles from where the audience is?   How\ndo you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience\nwithout violating the rules of the regime?  I don't think Mr. Nell was\nthrowing pies at Bush.  A sign, the last time I checked, didn't cause\nphysical injury, or even emotional harm.  If I remember Cohen v.\nCalifornia, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), its not the individual speaking that\nhas the requirement to desist, but the individual listening who has\nthe option to leave.\n\n\nJust my .02, while its still considered legal.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n\n"}
