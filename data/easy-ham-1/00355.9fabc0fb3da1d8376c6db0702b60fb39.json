QED.\n\n\nMy typical Java-to-C conversion doesn't increase the lines of code by\nmore than 20%, and a fair portion of that is the implementation of\nadditional features that drove us to do the conversion in the first\nplace.  Some things are substantially more succinct when written in C\nthan in Java.  C and most other mature languages have an endless\ncollection of libraries.  I personally don't use anything beyond the\ncore libraries of any language that much though.\n\nOn a tangent, I find libraries nearly useless for a great many things\ndue primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a given\nnon-trivial API almost always has a context in which it will function in\na pathological manner.  Code reuse is wonderful and all that, but\nlibraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me even\nif they theoretically do exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, it isn't\nparticularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a library\nthat really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases.  I've built\na small collection of flexible psuedo-polymorphic APIs over the years\nthat I tend to use, but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse when\nyou get right down to it.\n\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\n"}
