As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I \nreally think I'm going to pick this up. \n\n    That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current \n    competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same \n    spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively \n    high- speed \"GPRS\" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious \n    surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice \n    time is another story -- more on that later.) \n\n    Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and \n    will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing \n    hybrids focus on \"enterprise\" customers -- the big businesses that are \n    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most \n    clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their \n    own words, \"Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to \n    34-year-old demographic.\" \n\nI am that demographic!
