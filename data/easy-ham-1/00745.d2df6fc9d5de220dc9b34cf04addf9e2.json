Rohit]\n\nIn your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (\"The\nSearch Goes On\", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most\nsubversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which\nmerely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By\nmaintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web,\nif you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.\n\nThe techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce\nthese rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from\nGoogle, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all\nWeb browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)\nencryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to\nSSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle;\ncensorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in\nChina. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of\nIP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in\nthe article.\n\nOf course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic\ncosts real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free\nflow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors\nsponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest\nof the Web?\n\nTo date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector\nprogramming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just\nimagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure\naccess to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom\nof the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most\nof it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.\n\nOn second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting*\nthe use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...\n\nBest,\n   Rohit Khare\n\n===========================================================\n\nThe search goes on\nChina backtracks on banning Google�up to a point\n\nSep 19th 2002 | BEIJING\n From The Economist print edition\n\nIN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine,\nis gougou, meaning �doggy�. For the country's fast-growing population of\nInternet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving\nan elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked\naccess to Google from Internet service providers in China�apparently\nbecause the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to\nforbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been\nrestored.\n\nAn unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More\nsophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to\nuse Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government.\nAccess is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by\nGoogle as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for\nChinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.\n\nAfter the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users\nposted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move.\nTheir anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet\nproviders began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site\nto far less powerful search engines in China.\n\nDuncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm,\nBDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to\ncensor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking\nindividual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be\nfiltering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key\nwords that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this\nweek when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on\nGoogle for Falun Gong�a quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China�\nusually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search\nalso rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.\n\n\n\n"}
