He might have dreamed of becoming an\nace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined\ntoppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to\nuse the Internet to end world hunger.\n\nBut as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring\ndifferent academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do\nsomething more social and more interesting than working with computers.\n\nBesides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, \"you\ncan't get the chicks with that anymore.\"\n\nThe tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of\nsome fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the tech\nbust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has\ncome to a halt.\n\nThe number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in\n2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And\neducators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some\ncolleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.\n\nThe word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled\ninto the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of\nComputing Machinery.\n\n\"I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic\ndeclines,\" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering\nat Princeton University in January. \"It can be hard to see this, because at\nsome colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far\nexceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.\"\n\nAt Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science\ndepartment will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington\nUniversity, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer\nscience fell by more than half this year.\n\nInterest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the\npast decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and\ncomputer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing\nResearch Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees\nwere awarded.\n\nThe Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the\nfastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other\ncomputer-related industries trailing close behind.\n\nBut in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among\ncollege students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying\ninformation technology and engineering at George Mason University were\ncomputer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is\ndown to 800, although a newly created and more general information\ntechnology major has attracted 200 students.\n\n\"Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,\" said Lloyd Griffith,\ndean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.\n\"Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four\nyears on something and then not get a job.\"\n\nFreshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science major\nis expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland\ndecreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does\nnot account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College of\nComputer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\n\n\"We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their\ninterest in pursuing computer science as a major,\" Halperin said. \"That's a\nfactual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expect\nto see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no\nlonger expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.\"\n\nYandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not\nconvinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,\nwith a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his\nadvanced-placement exam in computer science.\n\n\"All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,\nso I looked for professions in which I could use those things,\" Yandziak\nsaid. \"I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I\nwant to do something that will contribute to the practical world.\"\n\nHarris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of\nAmerica, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,\nsalaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.\n\n\"There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the\nsame sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need this\nkind of IT training right now,' \" Miller said. \"Our concern as an industry\nis that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the\nroad four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to\nfind themselves in a shortage situation.\"\n\nEconomic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other\nfactors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social\ninfluences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional\ndevelopment at the American College Counseling Association. The perception\nof computer science as an isolating, \"nerdy\" profession is one that many in\nthe industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during\nthe tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.\n\n\"All the hipness is gone,\" Yandziak said. \"Once we thought of the Internet\nas this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that\ncame along.\"\n\nLamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in\nthe District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business\nmarketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.\n\n\"Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,\"\nThompson said. \"To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I\nthink of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's a\nnecessity, but I wouldn't take it any further.\"\n\n\n"}
