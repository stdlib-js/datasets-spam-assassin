Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying \ntraffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it \nreaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central \nantennas, and improving wireless coverage.\n\nAs the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and \nother devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless \nnetworking may be inevitable.\n\nMesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless \nnetworks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users \nconnection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a \ndial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection \nspeeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The \ntechnologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed \nwireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range \nprotocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even \nfaster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.\n\nThe range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of \nmuch use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the \nproblem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. \nEven though the range of any individual device is relatively small, \nbecause (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, \nconnections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless \nconnection.\n\nBecause mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed \nto create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building \ncellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all \nthat is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around \nï¿½100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the \nproper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by \nsoftware.\n\nIt also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. \nUnlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on \nis unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too \npleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds \nacquiring 3G licences.\n\nAll that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect \nto the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets \nbetter, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone \nnetworks.\n\nBut things get very interesting when you realise that when you have \nhigh-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, \nand mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing \nmusic, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When \nUltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.\n\nAt 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the \nperson sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. \nSooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of \ntheir favourite songs, movies, and video games.\n\nBut the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. \nMeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. \nInstead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities \nthat want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works \nemployees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the \ncheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for \nenterprise networks.\n\nThe first place average users may use the technology is when it is \nincorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at \nhigh speeds, which both companies see happening soon.\n\nWhen will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in \nyour pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service \nwas initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually \nsomeone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.\n\n\n\n\n"}
