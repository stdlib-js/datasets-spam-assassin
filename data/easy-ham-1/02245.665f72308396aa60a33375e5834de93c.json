In fact, I think it's \nabout time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are \ninexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. \nBut I digress.) \n\nIf you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the \npro-CSS camp[1]. \n\nSo anyway, d'ya remember that argument that went something like &#8220;you \nshould design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site \nfor the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile \ndevices&#8221;? Well, it's crap[2]. \n\nThere are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: \nautomatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced \nbandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim \nto know a lot about[7]), among others. But &#8220;because it'll future-proof \nyour site for the next generation of mobile devices&#8221; is not one of them. \nThe theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile \ndevices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice. \nOops.\n\n\n\n[1] http://diveintomark.org/archives/rooms/css/\n[2] http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/003378.php\n[3] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/02/01.html#print_me\n[4] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/02/13.html#css_fun_and_games\n[5] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/02/14.html#moral_arguments_aside\n[6] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/02/15.html#css_and_universal_design\n[7] http://diveintoaccessibility.org/\n\n\n"}
