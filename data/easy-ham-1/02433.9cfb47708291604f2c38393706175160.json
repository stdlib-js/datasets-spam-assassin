What she\ndoesn't have is the meat of the moose she hit and killed with her car on\nNov. 5, the moose that was rightfully hers, but instead went to a neighbor.\n\nThe lack of it has her embroiled in a fight with the York County Sheriff's\nDepartment to get back what she says she is owed.\n\n\"I think the deputy thought he was doing me a favor,\" said Pierce. \"I'm a\nwoman and he just neglected to think that I would want it. The moose is\ngone, I know that now. I want to be compensated for the meat.\"\n\nWhether or not that happens is uncertain. Her experience, though, highlights\na law some Mainers may not be aware of, but should get to know during this\npeak time of deer-versus-car accidents, as the animals, in their mating\nseason, come out of the woods.\n\nThe law is simple: A big-game carcass caught by a car - be it a moose, deer\nor bear - goes to the person who hits it, as long as a law enforcement\nofficer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident.\n\nIt comes up quite often in Maine, say officials. Last year, there were 4,055\ncases of vehicles and deer colliding on Maine roads and 600 accidents\ninvolving moose, according to Mark Latti, spokesman for the Maine Warden\nService.\n\n\"In a state of what, 1.4 million, with only 215,000 licensed hunters, I\ndon't know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out a\nmoose,\" said Latti. \"You do have the option of keeping it.\"\n\nWhich, for some people, can be valuable compensation for a damaged car.\nFarm-grown deer meat can retail for $8 to $20 per pound in stores. And a\nbutchered or dressed moose, which can't be bought or sold anywhere in Maine,\ncan produce hundreds of pounds of food.\n\nLatti said when it comes to moose, the law has been abused since its\ninception in 1991. Every now and then an officer will issue a summons to a\ndriver for intentionally killing a moose with a car. That kind of \"hunting\"\nmakes no sense to Latti.\n\nHitting a moose, even at a slow speed, is no laughing matter. Large adult\nmoose can weigh up to 1,500 pounds and can be more than 9 feet tall. Since\nthe bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars, their bodies\noften come crashing through windshields in collisions. More often than not,\ncrashes like these damage the vehicle, the people inside and the animal.\n\nSometimes they are fatal. In 1998, Latti said, there were six moose-related\nfatalities. After that, when the number of moose-hunting permits went from\n2,000 to 3,000, there were less. Maine had three moose-related fatalities in\n2000, one in 2001 and two this year so far, said Stephen McCausland,\nspokesman for the Maine Public Safety Department.\n\nPierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car\ndid not become part of that statistic early on Election Day. But she also\nfeels cheated by the whole situation. After all, her car was totaled.\n\nOn the morning of the accident, Pierce was taking her two children and a\nneighbor's son to school in her 1991 Dodge Dynasty. She said she was going\nalong at about 35 mph on a well-traveled road, when a moose came out of\nnowhere.\n\n\"By the time my brain could see moose, he was part of my windshield,\" she\nsaid. \n\nPierce is well aware of the law, so as she sat in the ambulance with the\nchildren, being treated for cuts and bruises, she thought about the moose.\nBut the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal\nwith it, so she said she wasn't able to follow up on the animal until later\nthat day.\n\nWhen she inquired, she was told the deputy on the scene gave the\nfully-racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor.\n\nHer neighbor, she said, subsequently offered her the moose for the $100 it\ntook him to carry it away, money she didn't think she should spend. By the\ntime she contacted the Attorney General's Office on Nov. 12 to complain\nabout the deputy giving her moose away, the neighbor's price had gone up\nanother $300 for the cost of butchering 450 pounds of meat.\n\nAnd when she called York County Chief Deputy Maurice Ouellette to complain\nthat she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer's\nfault that she didn't have it, Ouellette told her he could not give her cash\nand the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in York\nCounty.\n\n\"At that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore, but\nwanting money,\" Ouellette said.\n\nThat conversation, and a similar one she had with York County Sheriff Phil\nCote, left Pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the\nmoose.\n\nBut the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to\nother officials.\n\n\"It's the officer's discretion,\" said Latti. \"And if the officer feels the\nperson can't immediately remove (the animal), he's got to think of public\nsafety and other people on the roadway. If someone is worried about her\nchildren in her car, the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask\nis if she wants the moose.\"\n\nMaine State Police Trooper Jeremy Forbes said when he arrives at accidents\nthat involve a serious injury to a person, the issue of who gets the animal,\ndeer or moose, becomes secondary.\n\n\"The priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital,\" he\nsaid. \"If they are really hurt and going to the hospital, the animal can't\nwait, so we'll probably give it to the next person who stops by.\"\n\nThis is not comforting to Pierce. She said the deputy could have come to the\nambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose. With her\nboyfriend, a hunter, nearby, she could have easily taken care of the animal\nherself.\n\nShe knows her situation is probably a lost cause. But she hopes other\npeople, especially other women, do not have the same experience.\n\n\"What about people who don't know the law?\" she said. \"Standing up for my\nrights has just been a big headache.\"\n\nStaff Writer Giselle Goodman can be contacted at 324-4888 or at:\n\nggoodman@pressherald.com\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nforteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
