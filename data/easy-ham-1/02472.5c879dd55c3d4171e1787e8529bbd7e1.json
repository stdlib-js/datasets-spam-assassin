In a \"big city\" as small as San Francisco\nthere is, as I believe I stated in the initial\npost, maybe ONE PLACE in the whole that they\nshoulda kept their heads inside. They were told\nto, they didn't, and they got what was coming to\nthem. I'll feel bad about getting a sick chuckle\nout of it maybe when it happens to someone I know\npersonally. Til then, haw haw haw. Like the\nDarwin awards. Get it??\n          Sloanie\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail Plus ï¿½ Powerful. Affordable.
