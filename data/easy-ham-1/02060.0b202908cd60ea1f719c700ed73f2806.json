On Friday, I spoke at the University of Texas \nabout EFF issues. Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he \nblogged the hell out of the talk: \n\n    Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano \n    roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!), \n    \"the Betamax affair\"... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax \n    case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would \n    not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the \n    VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the \n    case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a \n    technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. \n    This principle is under attack. \n\n    Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright \n    measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits \n    distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content \n    scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another, \n    override copy protection. It was called DeCSS - Johansen is facing trial \n    for creating a piece of code.  \n\nLink[1] (Wes blogged it, too[2]) Discuss[3]\n\n[1] http://www.weblogsky.com/2002_09_01_blarchive.html#85500802\n[2] http://wmf.editthispage.com/2002/09/27\n[3] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/4rEePy7RSm38x\n\n\n"}
