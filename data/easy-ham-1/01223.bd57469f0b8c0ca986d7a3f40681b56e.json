The golden rule of the internet: when you find a free resource, don't piss'em off!  :)  I really appreciate your work; you get done the things I wish I could, and I respect that.\n\n> Anyway, although I'd easily recommend upgrading 7.x to 7.3 using apt, I\n> wouldn't for 7.x to 8.0 as they are C++ binary incompatible... and apt is\n> entirely written in C++ and dynamically linked :-/\n\n    OK, I'll search for the ISOs on the  one remaining site that isn't hammered.  :)\n \n> Still, that doesn't explain a core dump :-(\n\n    Sure: this is a linking issue, right?  Right now I'm still pure-vanilla.  I have the stock version of rpm/rpmlib/popt/etc and the recommended version of apt that you gave me.  No, wait...there's no new code getting loaded.  I don't know, either.  It's been a long day.\n\n> >     What's the inside secret here, or do I just start searching mirrors\n> >     for the ISO and get over it?\n> \n> Why \"search\"?
