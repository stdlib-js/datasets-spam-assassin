These addresses are all over the 70-some different \nekit/ekno/ISIConnect websites, so they get a LOT of spam.\n\nAs well as the usual spam, it also has customers complaining about \ncredit card charges, it has people interested in the service and \nasking questions about long distance rates, &c &c &c. Lots and lots \nof \"commercial\" speech, in other words. Stuff that SA gets pretty \nbadly wrong.\n\nI'm currently mangling it by feeding all parts (text, html, whatever \nelse :) into the filters, as well as both a selected number of headers \n(to, from, content-type, x-mailer), and also a list of \n(header,count_of_header). This is showing up some nice stuff - e.g. the \nX-uidl that stoopid spammers blindly copy into their messages.\n\nI did have Received in there, but it's out for the moment, as it causes\nrates to drop.\n\nI'm also stripping out HTML tags, except for href=\"\" and src=\"\" - there's\nso so much goodness in them (note that I'm only keeping the contents of\nthe attributes). \n\n\n--\nAnthony Baxter     <anthony@interlink.com.au>\nIt's never too late to have a happy childhood.\n\n"}
