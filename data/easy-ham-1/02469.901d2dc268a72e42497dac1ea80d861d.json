And they found an \nally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale \nfor anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The \nOmagh-based paper's 'As the Man Says' column brings a story which \noriginated in the Middle East.\n\n\"A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran,\" the columnist reports.\n\n\"He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands.\"\n\nIt is then explained: \"He had paid �625 to a local sorcerer and \nbelieved that he was invisible.\"\n\nIn the Lurgan Mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery.\n\n\"A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through \nthree walls to steal �10,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an \nattack which was well planned and professional,\" the paper reports.\n\n\"The thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop \nnext door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition \nbetween the back hallway and the front shop.\n\n\"Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then \ndrilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the \ncontents.\"\n\nThe owner of the Paper Chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole \nleft in his store and is quoted as saying: \"On Monday morning when my \nwife was opening, everything looked normal.\n\n\"But when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the \nshop next door.\"\n\nThe paper reports that the shop was the target of \"another well \norganised crime\" 12 weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe.\n\nThe shop's owner says: \"The closer it gets to Christmas the more \npeople are going to be open to this.\"\n\nThe issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the \nDown Democrat.\n\nWriting in the Downpatrick-based newspaper John Coulter calls on the \nauthorities to \"birch the vandals\" plaguing the local community.\n\nHe is shocked at reports of the \"wanton destruction by vandals\" and \nissues a call for action.\n\n\"The time has come to fight fire with fire,\" he writes, \"before \nunemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start \nusing so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of \nsentences on those found 'guilty' of anti-social behaviour.\"\n\nAs an alternative to such reckless violence, he recommends, \ncontrolled violence.\n\n\"It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the \nbirch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man.\"\n\nGetting his defence in early, he immediately rounds on any woolly \nliberal who may oppose his plan.\n\n\"In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is \nthe order of the day.\n\n\"You might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures \nbeing introduced in the United Kingdom or Ireland given that corporal \npunishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in \nthe late 1980s.\n\n\"However, people seem to forget that Islam is the fastest growing \nfaith on the British mainland and it's only a matter of time before \nit numerically passes Christianity.\"\n-- \nJoe McNally :: Flaneur at Large :: http://www.flaneur.org.uk\n--\n\"I am the centre which exists only because the geometry of the abyss \ndemands it.\" - Fernando Pessoa\n--\nCurrently playing: nothing.\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nforteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
