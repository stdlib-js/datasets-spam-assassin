This is because any granting of \nrights by an author must be clearly delimited\nin terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and \ntimes. In the absence of such limitations, the \noriginal author has the right to change his \nsoftware back to closed on a whim.\n\n\n{\n\nDavid Neary makes the point that the copyright \nholder automatically retains the right to change \nthe licence.\n\nScott replies it simply requires authorisation from \nall *copyright holders*\n\nThat's not my understanding. French law allows a \nGPL type licence *_on condition_* that the \nspecific conditions of the granting of such\nrights are clear - if they are not, there is\nnothing to stop the original author taking\nback \"his work\". The lawyers see this\n(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).\n\n}\n\n\n\n4) Hidden defects.\n\nRoughly, this clause means that the author(s) \nis/are liable for any defects if the consumer \nis not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up \nand data is lost, then the authors are liable.\n\n\n{\n\nCiaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have \nsimilar clauses - the point here is that they \nare *_all_* invalid - just that this one \naffects the GPL also.\n\nNiall O'Broinn makes the point that it is not\na sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement\nand that's why it doesn't come under this point.\n\nI would suggest that the whole thrust of this\narticle has been to see software \"sales\" (even\nif no money changes hands) as governed very\nmuch by consumer law (in France anyway).\n\n\nRick Moen makes the point that it is not\na sale but rather a granting of rights which\nare not default. \n\nSee the bit about even the granting of \nrights by an author having to be \nexplicitly specified - under French law.\n\n\nThe fact that two IP lawyers in France think that\nthe GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that \nthere is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.\n\n}\n\n\n\n5) Roughly.\n\nThere may be other reasons under French \nlaw why the  GPL may be invalid.\n\n\n\n-----  Whole Article. -----------\n\n\nFreedom(a) is worth more than these \nimperfect licences.\n\n\nSpecialised lawyers look at the GPL.\n\n\n\nLawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to \nthe court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both \nspecialised in the area of intellectual property \nexamine the \"free\" licences and in particular the \nGPL. They have published their study\nin the review \"Proprietes intellectuelles \n(Intellectual property)[1]\" and their\nconclusion is grim.\n\n\nTheir approach is interesting. The problem for \nthem is not to know whether freedom is valid under \nFrench law (for them the question is a moot point)\nbut rather they asked themselves about the form \nand the content of the text of free licences, and \nin particular the GPL. The problem is not free \nprogrammes, but rather the licence contracts of \nfree programmes.\n\n\n\nAbsence of critical clauses.\n\n\n\nThe authors tell us that first of all, the \nreference to \"copyright\" is not legally \nsufficient in the framework of international \ncontracts  (which is the case of licence \ncontracts for programmes developed and spread \nvia the Internet). The idea of copyright can \nbasically include differences from one country \nto another. This is why, under international \ncontracts, it is necessary to specify to which \nlaws one is referring (French law, American &c.).\n\nThe authors only found three public licences \nwhich were correctly formulated on this point: \nQPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public\nLicence).\n\n\n\nSpecification in the English language.\n\n\n\nNext, the authors remind us that (at least in \nFrance), no clause in a contract may be contrary \nto French law [2]. However, it turns out that a \nlicence such as the GPL is contrary to French law \nin several respects. Firstly, it is written in \nEnglish and the FSF doesn't officially approve \ntranslations. \n\nThe \"Toubon law\" obliges this sort \nof contract to be written in French, including for \nbusinesses since the notion of \"user\" applies not \nonly to consumers, but also to businesses, \nprofessionals &c. \n\n\nContacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, \nlawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as \nfar as business is concerned, the \"Toubon \nlaw\" is probably doomed to change since \nit is in contradiction of European directives \non the subject, but whatever about that, the \nproblem is still valid for individuals, and \nwhile waiting for it (French law) to change, \nFrench companies have to deal with it, since \nit is the law of the land.\n\n\nA programme under the GPL can suddenly \nchange licence.\n\n\nAnother problem, much more serious, is \nthat according to French law, the author of \na free programme can, at any time, invoke \nthe invalidity of the licence for this \nsoftware by simply changing the licence.\n\n\nIn effect, the law of intellectual \nproperty stipulates that the granting of  \nrights by the author is subordinate to \nthe condition that each of these granted \nrights be the object of a distinct clause \nin the granting act (i.e. the licence) and \nthat the granting of any such rights be \ndelimited with respect to its scope and its \ngrantees, and also with respect to its \nlocation (i.e. where such rights may be \nexcersised)  and duration of any such grants. \n[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of\nother free licences. Briefly, this means \nthat in France, or elsewhere if the author \nis French, that which is under the GPL could \nrevert to proprietary from one day to the next. \n \n\n\nThe problem of the guarantee \"hidden defects\".\n\n\nAn other very serious flaw is that of the \nguarantee. The GPL licences and others show \nthat the software is delivered \"without \nguarantee\". You are going to immediately\nreply that commercical programmes carry the \nsame clause in their licence contracts,\nand this is correct. However, whatever is \nwritten in a licence contract, one cannot\nfree oneself from the \"guarantee from \nhidden defects\", since it is imposed in the \nCivil Code. This concept is poorly understood \nby the layman, it protects the buyer\n(whoever it may be, individual or business, \nsince it specifies the Civil Code and not \nconsumer protection law) against hidden \ndefects, deliberate or made in good faith by \nthe seller. \n\n\nFor example, if one buys a pair of socks \nin a sale, and the shop has a notice \nspecifying that \"Sale items are neither \nrefunded nor exchanged\", and on arriving \nhome you notice that one of the socks has \na hole in it, several scenarios are possible.\n\n\nYou could have checked the socks before \npurchase: the flaw is deemed \"obvious\" and\nyou can sing for your money.\n\n\nYou couldn't check the socks (they were \npackaged for example), and in this case, \ndespite the notice \"neither refund nor \nexchange\", you may invoke \"hidden defect\" \nand have them changed or obtain a refund, \nit's up to you. \n\nPersonally, I have already invoked in shops \nthe \"hidden defect\" clause and it always \nworked well (shopkeepers are always very \ncooperative if you quote a couple of words \nof the Civil Code). \n\n\nThe concept of hidden defect is rather \nwide, it is necessary that you hadn't \nthe possibility of discovering the defect \nbefore buying the product and then \n(according to the Civil Code) that you \nwouldn't have bought it at that price if \nyou had known about the\ndefect.\n\n\nThe third case which is much rarer , is \nif you are able to show that the vendor had\nknowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't \ninform you. In this case, not only does he \nhave to reimburse the product, but all \nexpenses incurred by the sale (metro \ntickets to go to the shop, the fuse \nwhich blew when you plugged it in &c.)\n\n\nThis idea of \"hidden defect\" applies to\n all products, including programmes. This \nwas made abundantly clear by the \nauthorities (and the courts) surrounding \nY2K. \n\nThis is particularly inconvenient for \nfree programmes, since a site which \noffers a Linux distro for download is \nsupposed to provide a guarantee against \nhidden flaws.\n\n\nLinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if \nin the case of a free programme, \none could speak about a \"hidden\" defect \nsince the source code was available, \nhe replied \"Actually, concerning the \nguarantee, the question of obvious \ndefect will arise. This analyis will \nbe different depending on whether the \nperson who downloads the distribution \nis an IT professional or not\". \n\nOpenSource has this advantage over \nthe proprietary programme: it protects \nthe distributor against a guarantee of\nhidden defect insofar as the buy is an \nIT person. But, for distribution to the \npublic at large, the problem remains \nthe same.\n\n\n\nRoughly Speaking.\n\n\nLawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, \nthis study is far from being exhaustive \nand many other areas could be explored. \n\nDuring this interview, we asked ourselves, \nfor example, about the fragility of the \nGPL clause which forbids linking source \ncode under the GPL with proprietary code. \n\nIn effect, the laws of intellectual \nproperty give the right to the user \nto modify a programme with the\nintention of permitting interoperability \nwith another programme. If for that,\nI need to link with a proprietary library \n(communication protocol, device driver)\nI may consider as \"null and void\" this \nclause of the GPL.\n\n\nThe conclusion of this study is a wake \nup call for the community. \"Freedom\" \nmerits more than these shoddy licences, \nwhich should be modified before court \ncases over them proliferate and put at \nrisk the undeniable originality of \nthis effort.\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n[1] Une publication de l'Institut \nde recherche en propri�t� \nintellectuelle, No4 Juillet 2002\n\n[2] Une telle clause de contrat \nqui est oppos�e � ce que dit la Loi \nfran�aise est qualifi�e en terme \njuridique de � clause r�put�e \nnon-�crite �, c'est-�-dire \nqu'on fait comme si cette clause \nn'�tait pas �crite dans le contrat. \n\nC'est pour cela par exemple que vous \npouvez signer un bail pour un \nappartement qui stipule que \nles enfants sont interdits dans \nl'immeuble, et envisager sans \ninqui�tude d'avoir quand m�me \nun enfant, en effet le code civil \nstipule que le devoir d'un locataire \nd'un appartement doit se comporter \nen � bon p�re de famille � \n\n[3] Article L131-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!? -- Une adresse @yahoo.fr gratuite et en fran�ais !\nYahoo!
