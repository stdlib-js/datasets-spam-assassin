As you\nshould know, but evidently don't, poll() isn't even \"a bit better\" ---\nin fact, it's about an order of magnitude worse --- for dense file\ndescriptor sets, which is the normal case.  (Except on operating\nsystems where select() isn't a system call but a library routine that\ncalls poll().)\n\n> > Very few applications need the aio_* calls --- essentially only\n> > high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them at all, and\n> > most of those have been faking it fine for a while with multiple\n> > threads or processes.

After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally\n  catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for\n  nontrivial apps? No way!\n\nThe point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don't try\nto tell me you were trying to make a different point, because I don't\ncare --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; Unix\nhasn't been without this feature, and in fact has had it since you\nwere in elementary school, and operating systems without it don't\n\"totally suck for nontrivial apps\".\n\nFor what it's worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* calls\nfor a while, just in a way that doesn't scale to large numbers of\nconcurrent I/O requests.  I find references to the glibc\nimplementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and I could\nprobably find much earlier references if I had time:\nhttp://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/1999-12/msg00070.html\n\n(more details at\nhttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/docs/io-events.html;\ndetails on the SGI patch are at\nhttp://oss.sgi.com/projects/kaio/faq.html)\n\n> > Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations\n> > have supported multithreading for a decade or more.\n> \n> And most UNIX is still kinda-sorta supporting the pthreads (POSIX)\n> interface, each in their own 7/8 implementation. You're safe if you\n> stick to the basics.\n\nYour original complaint was that Unix didn't do multithreading or\nmultiprogramming well.  Now that I've pointed out how obviously\nidiotic that claim is, you've amended your complaint: now, although\nindividual Unixes do these things well, you complain that their\nimplementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threads\nspecification.  Well, that's probably true, but I haven't written\npthreads programs in C much myself, so I can't confirm it from my own\nexperience.  But, even if it's true, it's not a very good reason to\nprefer Windows.\n\nI'm sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threading\nimplementations.  Spare us.  Just shut up.\n\n-- \n<kragen@pobox.com>       Kragen Sitaker     <http://www.pobox.com/~kragen/>\nEdsger Wybe Dijkstra died in August of 2002.  The world has lost a great\nman.
