Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse\nengineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular\nthat an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third\nparty or otherwise) was in development.\n\nAll of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the\nprivate APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have\nupdated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have\nresigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first\nplace.\n\nBut what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly\nexclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.\nBut when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of\n\"known\" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it\nis not allowed to load.\n\nIt's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants\n\"developers, developers, developers!\", but Microsoft clearly understands\nsomething that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform\nvendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. In\nApple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to\nmake every single system service and UI element \"pluggable\" via public\nAPIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the\nnumber one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if\nthird party developers want to sell into a market that requires the\ndesired functionality to be added in \"unsupported\" ways, then they must be\nprepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.\n\nBut for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer\neffort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to\nprovide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. \"\n\n\n\n"}
