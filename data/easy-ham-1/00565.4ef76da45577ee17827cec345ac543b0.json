Did they do it tastefully? Oh\ncome on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use it\not promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good story\nlines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if the\nenviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed to\nhave finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines.\n\nBut of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you would\nrather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallign\non the old killsawfiles.\n\nSO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and say\nthat B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco,\nthier \"manager\"*, for  pushing them to carry out their \"gay\" act far too\nlong and just when things look to be heating up with that story\narc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronounces\nthat they have gone 3  minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its the\nBisch and in come Rosey  and Jamal to attempt a stomping on Stpehnie\nMcMahon. Hopefully they did  not get off a kick like they did on the first\nlesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib.\n\nOf course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of this\naround, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thier\nway to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will be\nedited much though from the way I heard it.\n\nSo the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were play\nacting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets a\nface push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push,\nthus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala  get heat\nand B and C get a new Tag Team to play with.  Ricco..who knows, maybe some\nheat time would be good for him as a single.\n\nAll this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4\nyear valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on\nborken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no\nlonger ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?\n\nWell, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz\nand Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.\n\n* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80's/early 90's.\nRicco is nota  Paul Bearer or a Jimmy Heart at all but more like a buddy\nwho goes to the ring with them and occasional interferes..ugh.\n\n\n\n\n"}
