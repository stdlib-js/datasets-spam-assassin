When wolves attack their sheep, they coral the wolf\ninto a quarry and then throw rocks from the surrounding cliffs so\nthat \"no one will know who killed the wolf\"\n\nIn Samskar, before the Chinese arrived, there had not been a killing\nin over 2000 years, and the last recorded skirmish, over rights to\na water hole, had happened several generations ago.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy - garym@teledyn.com - TeleDynamics Communications\n - blog: http://www.auracom.com/~teledyn - biz: http://teledyn.com/ -\n  \"Computers are useless.
