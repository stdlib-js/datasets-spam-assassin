You have the choice to ignore it\n\n\nThat's not what the First Amendment says at all. It says that Congress cannot \nsay what can't be FoRKed. FoRK can establish any rules it wants. Similarly, \nThe New York Times gets to choose what news IT thinks is \"fit to print.\" If \nthe Times chose not to print anything about, say, Rosie O'Donnell, it would \nbe exercising its First Amendment rights, just as much as it would be if it \nchose to print something Rosie O'Donnell doesn't like. The necessary \ncorollary of the freedom to say/publish what one wants is the freedom to \nrefuse to publish or say what one doesn't like. The alternative is a \nstate-controlled press that reprints government press releases and calls them \nnews.\n\nThe question of what is or is not FoRKed is (except for libel or other \nspecific exceptions) not a matter of law, but a matter of what the \n\"publisher\" (if any) decides or the \"community\" (if any) negotiates or does \nas a matter of custom.\n\nFor my part, I'd rather people didn't use FoRK as a place in which to dump an \nexpression of their political beliefs.\n\nTom\n\n\n"}
