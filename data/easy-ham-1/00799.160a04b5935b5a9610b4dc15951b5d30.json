That and some \nentity would be holding the passport info, thus have all that data in the \nfirst place.\nPersonally i'd never trust them not to at least use it internally to \nmarket to me, if not sell/rent out.  Just think of the ability \nthey'd have to build a profile for you since everything you went to was \ntracked to you.  And thats just the marketing side of it.\n\nChris\n\n\n\nOn Sat, 28 Sep 2002, Gregory Alan Bolcer wrote:\n\n> What's wrong with doing business over the Web?  Web forms.
