Most important are the particulars distinguishing\nthe listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:\n1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the\n   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is\n   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would\n   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.\n   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics\n   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,\n   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and\n    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)\n\n1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of 'internet keys'\n    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll\n    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.\n\n1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)\n    in BIOS, please.\n\n2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan\n   to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off\n   the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good\n  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you've got an\n  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)\n     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs\n  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display\n  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion\n  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)\n      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative\n  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle\n  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally\n  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them\n  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides\n  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little\n  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep\n  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) \n\n3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the\n    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to\n    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but\n    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified\n   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the\n   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with\n   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides\n   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted\n   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.\n     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,\n   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see\n   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great\n   candidates) base.  \n      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight\n    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-\n    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare\n    hood) to feed\n    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent \n    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.\n      The logo should be a coloration of a\n   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew\n   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/\n   at first blush.  We'll see what comes out of the contest and\n   maybe you'll like the mapping MathCAD does of the\n   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the\n   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.\n   MAA.org has more references, I'm sure.\n\n4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.\n\nOther details:\nUSB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that's unavailable.\nOptions like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port\nshould round out the offering.  An option for just-released \n.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more\nreviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,\nand almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.\nCompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card\ninterfaces would be very pleasant.  I've mentioned booting to\nUSB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.\nTo that end, a backup solution with compression using\nUSB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice \nbundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....\n\n\nBlue skies (and clear water and fresh air): \nWaterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.\nSvelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,\nbuiltin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and \nfrontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map\nand various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that\nsays 'This is Amiga Speaking' when stroked 'round. \nDecent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps \nan ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as \nkeyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.\n2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple \n18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our\n(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.\nActual 7\" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation \nfan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade\nRunner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling\nand airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user\nseat and provide mineral water.\nHyperTransport ports.\n\n\n"}
