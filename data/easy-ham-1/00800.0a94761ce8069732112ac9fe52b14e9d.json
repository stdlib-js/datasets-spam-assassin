If a bridge falls over, the architect or the\nengineer is in court the next day, but when a /software/ bridge falls\nover, we blame the air beneath it, or the phase of the moon, or\n(more often) the people walking on it.\n\n   \"What idiots!  Don't they know you're supposed to walk on the\n   /balls/ of your feet, not lead with your heels?  Didn't they read\n   the blueprints?  They were posted in the town hall.  Any idiot\n   would know the 0.75Hz heel cadence would pop rivets on the\n   structural supports!  Geez. Pedestrians are /so/ stupid.\"\n\nOurs is the /only/ industry that can hold itself 100% un-responsible\nfor any and all sloth-inflicted doom, and the only industry which can\n/also/ get away with feeding this myth of infallibility unquestioned\nto the media, to investors, to students and to each other.\n\n   \"God I hate telephones.  Telephones are stupid. I used a telephone\n   to, like, call my broker yesterday, and y'know, just /after/ I'd\n   ordered those 2000 shares of Nortel ...\"\n\nYou just gotta love a mass-delusion like that.\n\nAlthough it's like a total shock to 99.999% (5nines) of all the\nemployed website designers out there, the truth is webforms /can/\naccept \"U.S. of A\" as a country.  Incredible, but true.  Web forms can\nalso accept /multiple/ or even /free-form/ telephone numbers and can\neven be partitioned into manageable steps. All this can also be done\nwithout selling exclusive rights to your wallet to the World's\nSecond-Richest Corporation (assuming Cisco is still #1) and vendor\nlocking your business into their \"small transaction fee\" tithe.\n\nOf course, try and tell one of those 5-niners that and they'll get all\ndefensive, black list you as a sh*t disturber and undermine your\nreputation with the boss...  not that I'm speaking first-hand or\nanything ;)\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy - garym@teledyn.com - TeleDynamics Communications\n - blog: http://www.auracom.com/~teledyn - biz: http://teledyn.com/ -\n  \"Computers are useless.
