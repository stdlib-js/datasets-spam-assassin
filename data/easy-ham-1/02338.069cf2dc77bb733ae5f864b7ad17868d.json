We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince \nhim. After it was clear that wouldn't work, we threatened to bomb them and \nbegun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned \nto invade two months before the attacks. While it's not clear they knew about \n9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. \n\nThree days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline \nKarzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work \nfor the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline \nrather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable \nbecause it's too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. \n\nBin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn't \ncarry them out. It's far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, \ncarried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have \ngone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone \nafter Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect \nopportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize \nAfghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. \n\n\"Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or \nright, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for \njustice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their \nfriends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of \ninfluential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took \nadvantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central \nAsia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will \ncause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it.\"\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/pipeline0.html\n\n\n"}
