Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the\nway home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the\nsea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,\nand the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen\nfor once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and\nmaybe me and you, too.\nBut B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the\nBank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded\nhappy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic\nproto-warriors in the background.\nYou must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily\nMail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye\ncovered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't\nmock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom\nwe don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come\noff. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the\nBritish right) as \"Captain Hook\", in articles which usually call for his\narrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe\noff to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and\nthus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if\nwe can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him\nto shut up.\nBecause we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before\nSeptember 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all\nthought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political\npersecution.\nAnd now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've\ngot hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory\nmanner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of\ncontext, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But\nperhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and\ntolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's\nscoop.\nHamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier\nthis year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his\nallegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were\nmeant to do stuff like that.\nHe has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been\nfrozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the\nmedia is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations\nand the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly\n- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be\ntrue - Hamza is not \"representative\" of British Muslims, as if British\nMuslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could\nturn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.\nThe trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was\nrevealed to be rather more \"representative\" than the list of those\ngovernment-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -\ndragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism\nand a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.\nAn opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an\noverwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.\nOne in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US\n(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought\nthe war against terrorism was a war against Islam.\nWhich is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the\ntime, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at\nhome and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from\nthe liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US\nforeign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action\nagainst Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.\nNor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't\nsuppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,\nthe chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful\nfor the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.\nWhich is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has\nbeen wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more\ninflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His\nideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be\nhappy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for\nexample. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly\nrepellent.\nAnd that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire\nto be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful\nappropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the\nruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.\nMulticulturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that\nare antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.\nThe FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing\nremotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution\nis simply the pungency of his views.\nIt is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his\nrhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This\nis a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.\nYou don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And\nif British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of\nunease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is\nnot because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man\nup, therefore, won't make a difference.\nIt is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:\nThe glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.\nBut if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
