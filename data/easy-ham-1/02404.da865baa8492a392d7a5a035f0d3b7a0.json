Words fail me, which is a rare \nand pleasant gift, thank you. Instead, I will simply take this opportunity to \nquote the original _Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead_, the excellent \nplay by Tom Stoppard which I keep nestled in my one remaining bookshelf[2] \nbetween the _Tao Te Ching_ and Roald Dahl's _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_\n. \n\n    Guil: Exactly, it's a matter of asking the right questions and giving away \n    as little as we can. It's a game.\n    Ros: And then we can go?\n    Guil: And receive such thanks as fits a king's remembrance.\n    Ros: I like the sound of that. Waht do you think he meant by remembrance?\n    Guil: He doesn't forget his friends.\n    Ros: Would you care to estimate?\n    Guil: Difficult to say, really&#8212;some kings tend to be amnesiac, others \n    I suppose&#8212;the opposite, whatever that is...\n    Ros: Yes&#8212;but&#8212;\n    Guil: Elephantine... ?\n    Ros: Not how long&#8212;how much?\n    Guil: _Retentive_&#8212;he's a very retentive king, a royal retainer...\n    Ros: What are you playing at?\n    Guil: Words, words. They're all we have to go on. \n\n\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/stories/rosencrantz_joshua.shtml\n[2] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/04/19.html#alan_cooper_speaks\n\n\n"}
