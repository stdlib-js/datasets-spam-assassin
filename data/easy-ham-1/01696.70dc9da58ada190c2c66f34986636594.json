About half the developers on the spambayes project\nwere missing some permission or other, so I ran thru all of them and checked\nevery damned box and clicked on every damn dropdown list I could find.  As\nfar as SF is concerned, you're all sitting on God's Right Hand now, so if it\nstill doesn't work I suggest you upgrade to Win98 <wink>.\n\n"}
