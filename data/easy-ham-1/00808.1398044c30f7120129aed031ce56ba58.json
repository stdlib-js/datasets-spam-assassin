It includes computer calculations that\nhave produced a series of three-dimensional images of the\ncrumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,\nhelping to identify the sequence of failures that led to\nthe collapses. \n\nAn immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the\ndebris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been\naccumulated in a collection that far outstrips what\ngovernment analysts have been able to put together as they\nstruggle to answer the scientifically complex and\nemotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly\nfailures of the buildings. \n\nBut everyone from structural engineers to relatives of\nvictims fear that the closely held information, which\nincludes the analysis and the possible answers that\nfamilies and engineers around the world have craved, may\nremain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. \n\nBound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the\nexperts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they\nwait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are\ntypical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it\nnow stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that\ncertain material can remain secret for the time being - has\napproved standard legal arrangements that, should the\nlawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial\nmaterial generated by the competing sides to be withheld. \n\n\"We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, but\nwe can't until we're told what to do,\" said Matthys Levy,\nan engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,\nwho is a consultant in the case and the author of \"Why\nBuildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail\" (Norton, 2nd\nedition, 2002). \n\n\"Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the whole\nprocess\" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. \n\nMonica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the\nsouth tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper\nSafety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.\n\"If they have answers and are not going to share them, I\nwould be devastated,\" Mrs. Gabrielle said. \"They have a\nmoral obligation.\" \n\nThe lawsuit that has generated the information involves\nLarry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the\ntrade center property, and a consortium of insurance\ncompanies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner\nthat hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist\nattack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half\nthat amount, as the insurance companies say. \n\nAs both sides have prepared their arguments, they have\nspent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert\nopinion about exactly what happened to the towers. \n\nDean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of\nHartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said\nof the findings, \"There are some confidentiality agreements\nthat are keeping those out of the public domain today.\" He\nconceded that differing opinions among the more than 20\ninsurers on his side of the case could complicate any\nrelease of the material. \n\nAs for his own company, whose consultants alone have\nproduced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of\ndiagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt\nwould be made to give the material eventually to \"public\nauthorities and investigative teams.\" \n\nStill, some of that analysis relies on information like\nblueprints and building records from other sources, like\nthe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built\nand owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in\nthe suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the\ndiffering origins of the material would influence his\ncompany's ability to release information. \n\nIn a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents\nwould be \"decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with\napplicable law and policy,\" adding that it would cooperate\nwith \"federal investigations.\" \n\nThe fate of the research is particularly critical to\nresolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,\ngiven the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into\nthe buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few\nresources, a lack of access to crucial information like\nbuilding plans, and infighting among experts and officials.\nA new federal investigation intended to remedy those\nfailings has just begun at the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has\nstudied many building disasters. \n\nOfficials with NIST have said it could take years to make\nfinal determinations and recommendations for other\nbuildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded\nup with access to the analysis done by the consultants on\nthe lawsuit. \n\nGerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of\nthe real estate executive's own heavily financed\ninvestigative work, \"We decline to comment other than to\nsay that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST\ninvestigation.\" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was\nin discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but\nsaid no transfer had taken place. \n\nWith no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by\nboth sides in the legal case have produced a startling body\nof science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the\ntrade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. \n\n\"The work should be available to other investigators,\" said\nRamon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner\nat Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier\ninquiry. \"It could be used to build better buildings in the\nfuture.\" \n\nLegal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one\ngoverning the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,\nfrom full or partial disclosure to destruction of such\ninformation. In some cases, litigants who paid for the\nreports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to\nhave them sealed forever. \n\"It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep\nsome of those documents secret for one reason or another,\nsome legitimate, some not,\" said Lee Levine, a First\nAmendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. \n\nMr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the\ninformation, the court might look favorably on requests to\nmake it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the\nmaterial is unnerving to many people, especially experts\nwho believe that only a complete review of the evidence -\nnot piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect\ntheir own interests - could lead to an advance in the\nfederal investigation of the trade center. \n\n\"It's important for this to get presented and published and\nsubjected to some scrutiny,\" said Dr. John Osteraas,\ndirector of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure\nAnalysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the\ncase, \"because then the general engineering community can\nsort it out.\" \n\nThe scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by\nany measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger\nAssociates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called\nupon powerful computer programs, originally developed with\nthe Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of\nthe Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. \n\nThe result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of\nthe severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged\ncore of the towers, beginning with the impacts and\nproceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -\nwhich Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped\npinpoint the structural failures. \n\nThe FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer\nmodeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to\nthe trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks\nimmediately after the attacks. But no such constraints\nhampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to\nthe site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of\nSept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a\nconsultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he\nhad assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground\nzero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how\nthe towers fell. \n\nThough the FEMA team could not determine \"where things\nactually fell,\" Mr. Cuoco said, \"we've indicated the\nspecific locations.\" \n\nMr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details\nof the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details\nof computer calculations his company has done on the spread\nof fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.\nOsteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of\nphotographs and videos of the towers that day, some of\nwhich he believes have not been available to other\ninvestigators. \n\nAnd the investigation has not limited itself to computers\nand documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind\ntunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining\nthe aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed\nthe weakening structures. \n\nJack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort\nCollins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but\nhad previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the\noriginal design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For\nthe legal case, Dr. Cermak said, \"we've done probably more\ndetailed measurements than in the original design.\" \n\n\"The data that have been acquired are very valuable in\nthemselves for understanding how wind and buildings\ninteract,\" Dr. Cermak said. \"Some of the information may be\nvaluable for the litigation,\" he said, adding, \"I think\nI've told you all I can.\"\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/nyregion/30TOWE.html?ex=1034388663&ei=1&en=0d3143a997e5e2e1\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n\n\n"}
