Puncture a\nWashington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.\nScore 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate\nexecutive or World Bank delegate.\n\nD.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a\ncongressional hearing on Friday that law authorities\nwere in talks to decide whether planned protests were,\n\"so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to\ntake proactive action.\"\n\nSeveral thousand people are expected to demonstrate\noutside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next\nweekend.\n\nThe Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based\nanarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic\nblockade, banner-drops and protests against major\ncorporations in the downtown core.\n\nChuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site\nwww.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,\ntold Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.\n\n\"People were asking for things to do when they come to\nD.C.
