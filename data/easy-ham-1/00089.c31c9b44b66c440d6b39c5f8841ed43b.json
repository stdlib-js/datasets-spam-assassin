I have been trying to\nuse sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and\nwhen the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have\nchecked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how\nto set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail.  Do any of\nthe outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'\nconfiguration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration\nfiles like sendmail.\n\nAny suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated.  There\nare only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for\nscheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me\nfine.\n\nThanks,\n\n\tDavid.\n\nDavid Hamilton\nSenior Technical Consultant\nHP Ireland \n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
