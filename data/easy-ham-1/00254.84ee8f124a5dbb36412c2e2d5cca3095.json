I'm not a C programmer,\nbut I think that these sort of things (#include <blahblah>) are\ninstructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile\nprocess, and include all sorts of symbols/functions\ne.g. \"#include <math.h>\" gives you maths type functions.  Since they\nstart with \"#\" they are ignored in the final compilation.\n\nRegarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel\nsoftware to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. \nI recall from your previous mail that there was a flag\n    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4\nwhich could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate\ndirectory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to\npersuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this\nis the right way to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the steps above regarding \"make dep\" and so forth\nshould have been performed in the directory where the make process is\nlooking for modversions.h & Co.\n\nI don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as\nyou describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you\nhave done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after\nthat, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)\nfiles.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files\ndon't really belong there).\n\nFor what it's worth I think you are very close to a successful\ncompilation.\n\nm\n\n> \n> Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed \"make\", I noticed\n> that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h\n> file.
