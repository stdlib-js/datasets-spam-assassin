Also, because of the ability to send high-speed \n    data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable � such \n    as collecting seismic data at the drill bit � may now be possible. \n\n    With high-resolution seismic data collected \"ahead of the bit,\" operators \n    could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet \n    spots and away from less productive areas. This will enhance the efficiency \n    of oil and gas wells and reduce the number of wells needed to produce a \n    reservoir.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)\n\n[1] http://www.fossil.energy.gov/techline/tl_intellipipe.shtml\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/VRj5gZXZSGT\n[3] http://slashdot.org\n\n\n"}
