While that can be a drag while waiting for one of my\nfull test runs to complete (one of those scores a message more than 120,000\ntimes, and trains more than 30,000 times), I've got no urge to do any speed\noptimizations -- if I were using this for my own email, I'd never notice the\ndrag.  Guido will bitch like hell about waiting an extra second for his\n50-msg batches to score, but he's the boss so he bitches about everything\n<wink>.\n\n> That's profiler territory, and profiling is exactly the kind of\n> optimization I just said I wasn't going to do :)\n\nI haven't profiled yet, but *suspect* there aren't any egregious hot spots.\n5-gram'ing of long words with high-bit characters is likely overly expensive\n*when* it happens, but it doesn't happen that often, and as an approach to\nnon-English languages it sucks anyway (i.e., there's no point speeding\nsomething that ought to be replaced entirely).\n\n"}
