If they do, the decision could be a turning point \nin redefining a balance between copyright consumers and producers � and the \ntechnology companies that are often in the middle.\" \n\nNewsweek: Glitterati vs. Geeks[3]. \"Larry Lessig admits it: he�s nervous. Who \nwouldn�t be? [...] In its narrowest context, Eldred v. Ashcroft deals with the \nseemingly arcane issue of the length of copyrights for books, films and music. \nBut it�s actually a high-noon showdown between two great industries at odds in \nthe age of the Internet.\" 'There�s a sense of deja vu to this. Television was \nsupposed to be the death of movies. And in 1982, the film industry�s \nsilver-tongued lobbyist Jack Valenti testified that �the VCR is to the American \nfilm producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman \nhome alone.� (Video sales are now the studios� biggest moneymaker.) Naturally, \nHollywood regards the computer/Internet combo as scarier than �Nightmare on Elm \nStreet.�'\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.marketplace.org/\n[2] http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/07/business/media/07ARGU.html\n[3] http://www.msnbc.com/news/817175.asp\n\n\n"}
