First a lot of\n fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all\n end with a heart attack and then I�m gone.\" \n \n Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be\n sent in quickly because of his age. \"It could end very soon,\" he said.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
