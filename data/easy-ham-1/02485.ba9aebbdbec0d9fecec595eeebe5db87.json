If we get \ntwo senators for each of Scotland, Norn Iron, Wales and England, plus \nour fair share of congressthings, we end up with the biggest voting \nblock in the US legislature and for the presidency, with a political \nspectrum whose extreme right can't poke the extreme left of the \ncurrent US one with a long, long stick.  One sudden lurch to the left \nby the US political establishment later, we own the place.\n\nByzantium, anyone?\n\nAndrew D.\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nforteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
