But it sets the wrong precedent.\nHere's the better idea. Invite her for an afternoon\ncruise under the Golden Gate bridge in your Stonehorse\nday sailor. Under way, ask her if she'd like to take\nthe stick. Back at slip, cook her dinner. Something\nsimple, but good, maybe a stir fry or a stew, served\nin the cockpit, with an inexpensive but potable wine.\n\nIf she runs away after that, 'tis good riddance. If\nshe wants to try it again, another day, she shows\npromise. If she asks you to show her the V berth, you\nhave a girlfriend. If she notes your brightwork needs\nanother coat, and asks what you're using on it,\npropose on the spot.\n\n;-)\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \nhttp://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\n\n\n"}
