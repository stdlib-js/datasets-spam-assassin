Women who like to be thought of this way should have the \nright to choose to be treated this way.  Men too...  ahem.  (:  My boy \ncleans, washes clothes, cooks, fixes stuff, etc, and works the same number \nof hours I do, sometimes more, if he has to catch up with me.  (:  I \nclose him because he is industrious and creative, and because he \nunfailingly makes my bed the minute I get out of it.  And boy #2 will be \nhere soon to help boy #1 with other things such as pedicures,  backrubs, \nand sure, fucking.  LOL! (along with the aforementioned \"chores\") Adam can \nhave his cake and eat it too, if he can only find the right girl who has \nthe same beliefs about gender  roles that he has. Of course, he has NO \nclue where to look, so we will be constantly laughing at him while he \nstumbles around in the dark.  \nCindy\nP.S. the numbers do not in any way indicate importance or favor -- only \nthe order in which they move into my house.  -smiles at chris-\nP.S. #2.  I'm moving.   Going to New Orleans.  Can't handle any more cab \ndriving.  The summer sucked here on the MS Gulf Coast, instead of rocking \nlike it normally does.  Wish me luck.  I'm going to look for another \ncomputer job.  Le Sigh.
