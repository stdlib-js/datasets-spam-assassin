Maybe we can lower FPs a bit more.  :-)\n\nI don't think there's much more room for lowering FPs left which the GA can \nachieve.  Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't \nfactored in to the GA scores.\n\nThe work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of \ndoing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we \nreally ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as \ntime goes on.\n\nThe FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be \nbetter than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the \n2.41 or 2.50 branches.\n\nDQ> Something like:\nDQ> \nDQ>   for (low = -12; low <= -4; low += 2)\nDQ>     for (high = 2; high <= 6; high += 2)\nDQ>       evolve\n\nYou could just allow low and high to be evolved by the GA (within ranges); I'd \nbe enormously surprised if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, since \nthat'd give the GA the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores.  The \nissue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of \nhuman-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous \nand liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and \nliable to be forged to generate FNs.\n\nDQ> Maybe even add a nybias loop.\n\nAdding an nybias loop is not worthwhile -- changing nybias scores will just \nalter the evaluation function's idea of what the FP:FN ratio should be.\n\nDQ> > AFAIK there's nothing major hanging out waiting to be checked in \nDQ> > on b2_4_0 is there?\nDQ> \nDQ> Nope.\n\nGreat!\n\nDQ> > I'll be on IM most of today, tomorrow, and monday while cranking \nDQ> > on the next Deersoft product release (should be a fun one).
