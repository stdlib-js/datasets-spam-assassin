Some of the features can be a pain to get working (ie. pptp in\npppoe mode - can't figure it out). The documentation is not the best, but\nthe guys from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk will help you ouit. They\nalso have a message board.\n\nThe command line interface is quite powerful, but absolutely not\nuserfriendly.\n\nAll in all it's a cheap desent performer, that I am happy enough with.\nGot this one including a microfilter (not needed) for 140euro including\nshipping. Better than any deal from Eircom.\n\n-Tor\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
