Gnome 2.0, and GCC 3.2 - both very new,\nlarge projects.\n\n I'd not be putting it on any production machines for a while...\n\n Though many say \"RedHat X.0 releases are rubbish\" - it's worth baring in\nmind that they jump a release when the underlying archtechture changes, not\njust the installer, so they are .0 for a reason.\n\nKate\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
