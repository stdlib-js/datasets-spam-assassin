Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, \nwas one. Google News[1] is another. \n\nIn its first day, I've already noticed: \n\n- The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth's \nterminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by \nthe South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the \nlate evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. \n- The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? \nThe most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google's coverage is what is a news \nsite, and what isn't. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very \nobscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? \n- Big companies spend mucho money paying \"clipping services\" that send them \ncopies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have \nto find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly. \n\n[1] http://news.google.com/\n[2] http://www.concentric.net/~marsface/glossary.htm#sectT\n    The\nsunrise-sunset line dividing the day and night halves of the Moon or a\nplanet.\n[3] http://www.slashdot.org/\n[4] http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/\n[5] http://www.bluesnews.com/\n[6] http://www.scripting.com/\n[7] http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&q=%22Danny+O%27Brien%22&btnG=Google+Search\n[8] http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&q=www.ntk.net&btnG=Google+Search\n\n\n"}
