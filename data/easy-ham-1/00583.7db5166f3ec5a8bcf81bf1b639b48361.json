The murder \nof children is something of an Indian specialty. The routine daily \nkillings of unwanted girl babies . . . the massacre of innocents in \nNellie, Assam, in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring \nvillage . . . the massacre of Sikh children in Delhi during the \nhorrifying reprisal murders that followed Indira Gandhi's assassination: \nThey bear witness to our particular gift, always most dazzlingly in \nevidence at times of religious unrest, for dousing our children in \nkerosene and setting them alight, or cutting their throats, or \nsmothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length \nof wood.\n\nI say \"our\" because I write as an Indian man, born and bred, who loves \nIndia deeply and knows that what one of us does today, any of us is \npotentially capable of doing tomorrow. If I take pride in India's \nstrengths, then India's sins must be mine as well. Do I sound angry? \nGood. Ashamed and disgusted? I certainly hope so. Because, as India \nundergoes its worst bout of Hindu-Muslim bloodletting in more than a \ndecade, many people have not been sounding anything like angry, ashamed \nor disgusted enough. Police chiefs have been excusing their men's \nunwillingness to defend the citizens of India, without regard to \nreligion, by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to \nthe same sentiments as the nation in general.\n\nMeanwhile, India's political masters have been tut-tutting and offering \nthe usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control. \n(It has escaped nobody's notice that the ruling party, the Bharatiya \nJanata Party (BJP), or Indian People's Party, and the Hindu extremists \nof the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or World Hindu Council, are sister \norganizations and offshoots of the same parent body.) Even some \ninternational commentators, such as Britain's Independent newspaper, \nurge us to \"beware excess pessimism.\"\n\nThe horrible truth about communal slaughter in India is that we're used \nto it. It happens every so often; then it dies down. That's how life is, \nfolks. Most of the time India is the world's largest secular democracy; \nand if, once in a while, it lets off a little crazy religious steam, we \nmustn't let that distort the picture.\n\nOf course, there are political explanations. Ever since December 1992, \nwhen a VHP mob demolished a 400-year-old Muslim mosque in Ayodhya, which \nthey claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god Ram, Hindu \nfanatics have been looking for this fight. The pity of it is that some \nMuslims were ready to give it to them. Their murderous attack on the \ntrain-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful, atavistic echoes \nof the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the \npartition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists' hands.\n\nThe VHP has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and \ninsufficient radicalism of India's BJP government. Prime Minister Atal \nBihari Vajpayee is more moderate than his party; he also heads a \ncoalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the BJP's \nmore extreme Hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together. \nBut it isn't working anymore. In state elections across the country, the \nBJP is being trounced. This may have been the last straw for the VHP \nfirebrands. Why put up with the government's betrayal of their fascistic \nagenda when that betrayal doesn't even result in electoral success?\n\nThe electoral failure of the BJP is thus, in all probability, the spark \nthat lit the fire. The VHP is determined to build a Hindu temple on the \nsite of the demolished Ayodhya mosque -- that's where the Godhra dead \nwere coming from -- and there are, reprehensibly, idiotically, \ntragically, Muslims in India equally determined to resist them. Vajpayee \nhas insisted that the slow Indian courts must decide the rights and \nwrongs of the Ayodhya issue. The VHP is no longer prepared to wait.\n\nThe distinguished Indian writer Mahasveta Devi, in a letter to India's \npresident, K. R. Narayanan, blames the Gujarat government (led by a BJP \nhard-liner) as well as the central government for doing \"too little too \nlate.\" She pins the blame firmly on the \"motivated, well-planned out and \nprovocative actions\" of the Hindu nationalists. But another writer, the \nNobel laureate V. S. Naipaul, speaking in India just a week before the \nviolence erupted, denounced India's Muslims en masse and praised the \nnationalist movement.\n\nThe murderers of Godhra must indeed be denounced, and Mahasveta Devi in \nher letter demands \"stern legal action\" against them. But the VHP is \ndetermined to destroy that secular democracy in which India takes such \npublic pride and which it does so little to protect; and by supporting \nthem, Naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces \nthe Nobel award.\n\nThe political discourse matters, and explains a good deal. But there's \nsomething beneath it, something we don't want to look in the face: \nnamely, that in India, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is \nthe poison in the blood. Where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no \nexcuse. Yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in \nthe fashionable language of \"respect.\" What is there to respect in any \nof this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around \nthe world in religion's dreaded name? How well, with what fatal results, \nreligion erects totems, and how willing we are to kill for them! And \nwhen we've done it often enough, the deadening of affect that results \nmakes it easier to do it again.\n\nSo India's problem turns out to be the world's problem. What happened in \nIndia has happened in God's name. The problem's name is God.\n\nSalman Rushdie is a novelist and author of the forthcoming essay \ncollection \"Step Across This Line.\"\n\nï¿½ 2002 The Washington Post Company\n\n\nsdw\n\n-- \nsdw@lig.net http://sdw.st\nStephen D.
