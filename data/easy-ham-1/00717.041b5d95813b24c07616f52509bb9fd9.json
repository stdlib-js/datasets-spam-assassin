All of those who\nperished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers\nand a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic\namenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish\nthat those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and,\nindeed, for all of us.\n\nBut for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square\nfeet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers\nmust be replaced on the site.\n\nAbout 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,\nalong with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.\nTogether, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the\neconomic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%\nof the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms\nhave relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New\nYork City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit\nmay become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.\n\nIf we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the\nvibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them,\nand there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers\nmade a powerful statement to the world that said, \"This is New York, a\nsymbol of our free economy and of our way of life.\" That is why they were\ndestroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and\nwith buildings that make a potent architectural statement.\n\nIn recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many\nsources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on\nall of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square\nfeet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or\nsimply never rebuilt.\n\nThese proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be\nrecovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over\nthe towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the\noffice and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.\n\nAccess to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.\nThat was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy\nbefore 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has\nremotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway\nand PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements\nplanned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct\n\"Train-to-the-Plane\" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes\neven more the logical locus of office development.\n\nAnd New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task\nforce of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury\nSecretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60\nmillion square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the\nanticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only\nheightens the need.\n\nAs for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown\ncannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that\nhistory shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of\noffice space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased\nup. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the\nbeginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,\nat an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.\n\nWe are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site\nover a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on\nline until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an\nannual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s'\nrate.\n\nThose who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it\npreviously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an\nextended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor\nwill most New Yorkers.\n\nMayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times\nthat the city \"has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the\nfuture.\" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --\nand that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural\nsignificance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what\nhappened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as\nresidents of the area.\n\nThe challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.\n\nMr. Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties, a real estate firm\nwhose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the World Trade Center site.\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
