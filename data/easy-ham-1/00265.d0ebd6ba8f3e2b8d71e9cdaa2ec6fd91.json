I was shocked. What about Gettysburg \nand the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? \nJust look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His \nclass had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big \nbeefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, \nthere was some of that. But the main difference between my son's text \nand that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous \ndecision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American \nhistory. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and \nreciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping \nfor easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation \nof freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it \nbecome possible to see the federal government's main function as \nresponding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, \ninstead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic \ninterests.\n\nEven now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty \nspeeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you'd find \nis thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so \nmuch over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real \nestate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which \nthis competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and \ncommissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It's \nan insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because \nthe public and the press�encouraged by the players, who speak in jargon�\ncan't get themselves interested.\n\nOne corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal \nCommunications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand \ndenizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate \ncommerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that \nthe commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription \nprice: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they \ngrumblingly attend the Chairman's Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where \nthe high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating \ncomedy routine by the commission's chairman.\n\nOf all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that \nAmericans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with \na business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the \nAmerican economy, as well as important aspects of daily life�telephone \nand television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now \nF.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, \nbecause a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the \n\"corporate scandals\" concerns the economic collapse of companies \nregulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, \namong others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is \npart of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney \nanalyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the \nembodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the \npast two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions \nof dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a \ndead weight pulling down the entire stock market.\n\nThis year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state \nof the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes \nF.C.C. World's feverish mood (\"The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns\") \nand suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of \nthe commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I \njust quoted is followed by this explanation: \"The ILECs appear likely to \nenter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no \nresidential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% \nmarket share loss in business lines to CLECs.\" It's a lot easier to \nthink about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.\n\n\nEven in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the \ncommission's chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially \nintense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes \nitself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael \nPowell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, \nbecause he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. \nUnlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which \ngenerates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about \nwho he really is and what he's really up to. Powell is young to be the \nhead of a federal agency�he is thirty-nine�and genially charming. \nEverybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years \none of the F.C.C.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the \nF.C.C.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the \narcane details of communications policy. He's always saying that he's an \n\"avid moderate.\" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his \npredecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell \nto Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, \ncalls him \"radical and extreme.\" Just as often as he's accused of being \na right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically \ncautious. \"It ain't about singing 'Kum-Ba-Yah' around the campfire,\" \nanother former chairman, William Kennard, says. \"You have to have an \nanswer.\" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate \nsubcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the \nsubcommittee's chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated \nhim. \"You don't care about these regulations,\" Hollings said. \"You don't \ncare about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That's the \nfundamental. That's the misgiving I have of your administration over \nthere. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and \nseem to not care at all. I think you'd be a wonderful executive \nvice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a \nregulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your \njob?\"\n\n\"Extremely,\" Powell said, with an amiable smile.\n\n\nOne cannot understand Powell's maddening effect, at least on Democrats \nand liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose \nof the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was \ncreated by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the \nNew Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy \ncases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure \nthat broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its \nother original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, \nthe national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers \nunfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, \nwell-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial \nsupervision�its real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition \namong communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by \nartfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. \nIn addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission \nmore specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many \nof whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most \nterrifying category of interest group�you can cross the local bank \npresident and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. \nAccording to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once \nblocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers \nin the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the \nanti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV \nstation in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.\n\n\nF.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, \nbecause all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic \nniches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful \nbreakup of A.T. & T.�by far the biggest and most important company the \ncommission regulated�deposited a thick additional sediment of \nself-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation \nago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one \nlong-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, \nwhich customers were not permitted to own�and they were all the same \ncompany. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the \nmid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local \nphone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing \nto offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores \neverywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers�and \nmillions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the \ntelephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a \"natural \nmonopoly,\" requiring protection from economic competition and total \ncontrol over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, \nthe F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones \nand the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: \nconsumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more \nprosperous, too.\n\nThe next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \none of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which \nmost people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. \nAlthough the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of \nmodernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group \nbargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers \nas \"baby Bells\" and to F.C.C. World as \"arbocks\" (the pronounced version \nof RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to \noffer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance \ncompanies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for \ncustomers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would \nget the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more \ncompetition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and \neconomics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by \nVice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as \nhelping to reposition them as the technology party�the party that \nbrought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of \njobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose \nbeneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. Clinton's \nslogans about the \"information superhighway\" and \"building a bridge to \nthe twenty-first century,\" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully \nsent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical \ncorrelates of the Telecom Act, and Gore's cruise to the Presidency was \nsupposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.\n\nThe F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, \naggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like \nall important interest groups they work with both parties); they \nimmediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new \ncompetitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through \nrule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by \nReed Hundt, who was Gore's classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep \nthe arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies \nlike A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new \ncompanies, \"see-lecks\" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive \nlocal exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory \nequivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have \naccess to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the \nseeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the \nF.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.\n\nPartly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that \nhe would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming \ncondition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the \nsee-lecks�companies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligent�and \ninto other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related \ntechnology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom \nboom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks \nand other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests \nof the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt's \nformer lieutenants told me, \"Reed used to joke that my job was to make \nsure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.\"\n\n\nThe years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the \nboom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more \nstartups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: \nTime Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and \nComcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys \nbelieved that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative \naccounting would go unnoticed because the market was so \nundiscriminating.)\n\nBy the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been \ndetermined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the \nchairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of \ninfluence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. \nThree Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; \nHarold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and \nPatrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as \nsuch, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most \npowerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of \nS.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant \nthat the arbocks didn't want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he \nmight be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he \nwasn't as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative \nmovement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than \nFurchtgott-Roth.\n\nPowell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared \nbefore a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and \ngave a very Michael Powell speech�whimsical, intellectual, and \nfree-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore's Law)�that \nbegan by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new \ntelecom companies alive. \"In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is \noften cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,\" Powell said. \"Like the \nWhos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast \nbeast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the \nderegulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act's \nfertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the \nleast, so it is thought.\" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became \nchairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as \npart of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day \nof the Bush Administration.\n\nTwenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead \nor dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in \nserious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite \ncompanies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically \nconcentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing \ncompanies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in \ngood shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged \ncompanies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the \nfinancial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications \nindustry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells \nwind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and \nif they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national \nduopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. \nAnd these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the \npoor health of the long-distance companies.\n\nThe cable business also seems close to having two dominant national \ncompanies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they \ndon't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more \nfully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. As part \nof the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 \nTelecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were \nsignificantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of \nradio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five \nper cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news \nprogramming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary \nof Viacom.\n\nIn this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should \nbe hyperactive�the superhero of government regulation, springing to the \nrescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try \nto breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should \ndisallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the \nforces of concentration. It should use the government's money and muscle \nto get new technology�especially fast Internet connections�into the \nhomes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (An \nanalogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and \nthe Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush \npeople, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush \npeople blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many \nexpectations and stirred too many passions.)\n\nBut Michael Powell's F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been \nconducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the \nF.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him \nsignals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of \nthe F.C.C.'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn't mean he has \nbeen inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further \ninfuriates his critics�in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and \nthe provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of \nF.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he's \nhaving the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, \nwhen he was asked what he was going to do about the \"digital \ndivide\"�that is, economic inequality in access to the Internet�he said, \n\"You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I'd like to have one and \nI can't afford one.\" At the National Cable & Telecommunications \nAssociation convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of \ntumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a \nsomersault.\n\n\nNot long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until \n1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest \nWashington, near the city's open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at \nthe western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody \nelse at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building \nlooks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. \nEven the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and \nfluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and \nwalks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a \njeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because \nof the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he \nbecame entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly \nthe idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of \nthe market before the fact�\"prophylactically,\" as he likes to say�should \nwait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust \nlitigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and \nthen became a prot�g� of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division \nof the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government's \nlegal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of \nthe New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell's political \nskill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush \nAdministration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but \nalso maintains close ties to Bush's nemesis Senator John McCain, of \nArizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his \nenduring love of law school�\"It's sort of like a law-school study \nsession over there,\" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to \nconfirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law \nstudents, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.\n\nI began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions \nof the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the \nairwaves among themselves without the government being involved?\n\n\"I think we'll never know,\" Powell said. \"I don't think it's an \nautomatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably \nthe best analogue. We don't seize all the land in the United States and \nsay, 'The government will issue licenses to use land.' If my neighbor \nputs a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law \nabout what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If \na wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a \nsimilar proposition. There are scholars who argue�indeed, the famous \nRonald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this�that \nspectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds \nof ways that we're accustomed to.\"\n\nTalking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he \ndoesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He \nslumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in \nironic air quotes. He's like your libertarian friend in college who \nenjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions \nabout aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he \nsees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he \nthought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications \nAct had been excessive.\n\n\"I would start with a caveat,\" Powell said. \"Look, I can't fault those \njudgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. \nThey were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. \nBut, frankly, I've always been a little bit critical. First of all, \nanybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close \nto matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President \non down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. I mean, I \ndon't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, \nor what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that \nwere a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts \nreading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. \nBut, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet \nexcitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it \ncertainly was.\n\n\"But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of \nexpectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the \neconomy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically \nexaggerated expectation�by the leadership of the commission, by \npoliticians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a \ngold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones \nthat government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to \nsee numbers go up on the board.\"\n\nPowell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. \" \n'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see \nthirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the \nBells to bleed! Then we'll know we've succeeded.' \" Now Powell returned \nto being Powell. \"I think that expectation was astonishingly \nunrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they're \nthere. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And \nthe market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There's no \nquestion, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much \ndebt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business \nmodel.\"\n\nHow could the Telecom Act have been handled better? \"We could have \nchosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were \nslightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,\" \nPowell said. \"Money chased what seemed like government-promised \nopportunity. The problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're \nin it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This \ndebt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some \nways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.\"\n\nPowell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there \nhad been a more \"reasonable\" level of investment. \"No, we wouldn't have \nevery home in America with competitive choice yet�but we don't anyway. I \ndon't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. I don't buy \nthat. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? The \npart of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so \nwould MCI WorldCom and Sprint.\"\n\nOther local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable \nbusinesses, either, and they never might. \"Everybody's always saying, \n'The regulators did this and this and this.' But, candidly, the story's \nquite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six \nyears to give them a chance. Conditions don't get that good except once \nevery thirty years, and it didn't happen. So, whatever the reason, we're \nlooking at a WorldCom that's teetering. We're looking at a long-distance \nbusiness that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is \nbreaking itself up. Sprint has struggled.\"\n\nCould the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies \nstronger? \"At the F.C.C.? I think I'll just be blunt. My political \nanswer? Yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try \nto help. But I can't find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. \nI can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. \ninvestigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don't have \nthose kinds of levers. I don't know whether anybody does. At some point, \ncompanies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from \ndying.\" Powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think \nit's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has \ndemonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist \ngestures�in August, for example, five months after disbanding the \nF.C.C.'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was \nappointing a committee to study accounting standards in the \ncommunications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding \nout the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore \nup the telecom industry.\n\nI asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one \ncompany provided cable television and only one provided local phone \nservice. \"Yes,\" he said. \"It concerns us that there's one of each of \nthose things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one \nof each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications \ncapabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other.\" \nAnyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to \nprovide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will \nprovide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. \n\"So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question \nis, Does it stay that way?\"\n\nThe concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of \ninformation did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that \npeople confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, \nwhich distorts markets. \"If this were just economics, it's easy. If you \nwere to say to me, 'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we \nknow how to do that�the econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a \nmarket's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is \nother dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take \nthe question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption \nthere is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic \nviewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. I \nthink that's a possibility. I don't think it's nearly the possibility \nthat's ascribed to it sometimes.\"\n\nPowell explained, \"Sometimes when we see very pointed political or \nparochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the \nsame people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh \nexists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off \nthe planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, \nand then we have policies like\"�here his tone went from ironic to \nsarcastic�\"the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis \nof what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed \nand opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic \nfairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.\"\n\n\nF.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he \ncan't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries \nhe regulates�so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the \nmarket, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he's carrying \nwater for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is \nplanning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed \nAttorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn't want to do anything \nat the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he's \nwaiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, \nso that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the \ncrossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television \nnetworks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of \nTelecom, after Colin Powell's idea that the United States should never \ncommit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, \nand an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he \nsays, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and \nirreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.\n\n\"This is why elections matter,\" Reed Hundt, who isn't happy about what \nhas become of his Telecom Act, told me. It's true that the F.C.C.�much \nmore than, say, the war in Afghanistan�is a case in which a Gore \nAdministration would be acting quite differently from the Bush \nAdministration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but \nthere's no question whether communications companies have noticed. The \narbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would \nhave done if Gore had won. Next election, they'll help the party that \nhelped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the \narbocks' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivals�the \nlong-distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts�with their \nfriends now in power, will stage a comeback. America's present is not \nunrecognizably different from America's past.\n\n\n"}
