The written words are then translated\ninto English and read out by a speech synthesizer. \n\n\"It went reasonably well half the time,\" said Mr Frederking, though it was\nslow in translating phrases. \n\nThe research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the\nfield. \n\nBut they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to\nwork with further research and development. \n\nThe Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between\nthe US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity. \n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
