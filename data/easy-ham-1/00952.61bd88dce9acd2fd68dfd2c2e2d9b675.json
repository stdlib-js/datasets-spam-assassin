If you look in the code, there are various places \nwhere the time function is called in order to see how long it took to do \nthings.  You'll probably want to borrow that technique.\n\nChris\n\n-- \nChris Garrigues                 http://www.DeepEddy.Com/~cwg/\nvirCIO                          http://www.virCIO.Com\n716 Congress, Suite 200\nAustin, TX  78701\t\t+1 512 374 0500\n\n  World War III:  The Wrong-Doers Vs. the Evil-Doers.\n\n\n\n\n--==_Exmh_-1977488590P\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Exmh version 2.2_20000822 06/23/2000\n\niD8DBQE9aq9vK9b4h5R0IUIRAkZrAJ4uCzn3j+5JlaqhDeEOVBMZlSATqwCdGO8z\ngy5px3yMpRraa8JkwHRwmM0=\n=fGBe\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n--==_Exmh_-1977488590P--\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n"}
