Its relevance is nil.\n\nIt was a extreme contrived example because you glosded over the \npoint of the earlier 3-person example. \n\nBut OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They \nall pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with \nall the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. \n\nPick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice of\nvalues results in meaningful differences between the sexes' \n\"promiscuity\", as commonly understood. It should be more \nobvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true \nfor any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.\n\nFurther, and I was hoping this would be clear without saying\nso outright, this model actually approximates the cliche \n\"common wisdom\" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you \nreverse the male and female roles.\n\nThose stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple\npartners -- men being \"more promiscuous\" than women -- and that \nsurplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of \nhyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled \"sluts\").\n\n> So I chose not to type \"on average\" explicitly in my post, since this\n> is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.\n> \n> There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested\n> in typical behaviour and you in extreme. \n\nNope, now you've amended the meaning of your initial statement to\nmake it more defensible. What I objected to was:\n\nRobert Harley:\n# >The assumption that females of all species tend to be less promiscuous\n# >than males simply does not fit the facts, Hrdy contended.\n# \n# Well, DUH!!!\n# \n# It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,\n# precisely identical between males and females.\n# \n# Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.\n\nIf you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have needed\nto jump in with a patronizing \"DUH!!\"? \n\nIf you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have \nhuffed and puffed with the words \"perfectly obvious\" and \"exactly, \nprecisely identical\"? \n\nIf your concern was with the \"typical\", why didn't you adopt the \ntypical definition of \"promiscuous\", rather than a straw-man\ndefinition which allowed you to interject \"DUH!!\" and mock an\nanthrolopology professor's conclusions? \n\n> Actually, you probably just\n> had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.\n\nYou are welcome to that theory!\n\nBut here's an alternate theory: when you jump in with a patronizing \nand overblown pronouncement -- e.g. \"DUH!!... perfectly obvious... \nexactly, precisely identical...\" -- and that pronouncement is \nitself sloppy and erroneous, then others may get a kick out of \npopping your balloon. \n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n"}
