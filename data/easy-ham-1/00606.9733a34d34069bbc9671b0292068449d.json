In order for the\ntwo flows to balance, the higher\npacket must contain less air than\nthe lower, and the mass balance\nof the flows corresponds thusly:\n\n    high percentage of thin air\n    ---------------------------\n    low percentage of dense air\n\nNow, rates are exponential in\nenergy differences[1], so that\ntheoretically we should expect\nan exponential decay in height,\nto compensate.  How does it go\nin practice?\n\n-Dave\n\n[0] How well does it balance?\n    Chemical equilibria seem \n    stable, as they deal with\n    very large numbers over a\n    very long time.  Economic\n    equilibria are viewed from\n    the mayfly standpoint of\n    individual people, and so,\n    at best, the shot noise is\n    very visible.\n\n[1] That is to say, rates will\n    be exponential in the free\n    energy differences between\n    endpoints and a transition\n    state.  We can ignore that\n    complication in this model.\n\n\n"}
