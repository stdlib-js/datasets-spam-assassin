And it seems to give people all sorts of license to \ninterrogate you as to why you're writing with a double of scotch :-)\n\nBest,\n   Rohit\n\n> Five Best Ways to Impress Your Date\n>\n> You've met the biped of your dreams at the corner laundromat and, \n> wonder of wonders, she's agreed to go out with you this Saturday. Don't \n> blow it! Follow the instructions below and even if you impress your \n> date so much you never see her again, your evening will be a memorable \n> one. All you need are a chauffeur, a change of clothes, and several \n> hundred thousand dollars.\n>\n> Luxury Suite at Pacific Bell Park\n>\n> Third and King streets, 972-2000, www.sfgiants.com\n>\n> Kick off your date with an afternoon at the ballpark -- not just any \n> ballpark, but just about the best ballpark in the country, and not in \n> some drafty, behind-the-plate box seat but in one of the park's lushly \n> accessorized luxury suites. An elevator whisks you from a private \n> entrance on Willie Mays Plaza to your dwelling place above the infield. \n> Besides the excellent views of the bay, the park, and the Giants in \n> action, there's a balcony, a wet bar, a refrigerator, two televisions, \n> a stereo/CD player, a dual-line phone, Internet access, room service, \n> and a concierge to call you a cab or make your restaurant reservations \n> for you. No one is admitted without proper clearance, ensuring your \n> utmost privacy. Next: Pull yourself together for ...\n>\n> Cocktails at Lapis\n>\n> Pier 33 (Embarcadero at Bay), 982-0203,\n>\n> www.lapis-sf.com\n>\n> Now that the Redwood Room has devolved into just another velvet-rope \n> yuppie hangout, the city has no clear-cut, top-of-the-line cocktail \n> lounge such as Chicago's Pump Room or New York's King Cole Bar \n> (although Maxfield's, the Compass Rose, and the Top of the Mark are \n> excellent runners-up). Best of all is Lapis, where the wannabe Noel \n> Coward can sip an estimable Gibson in the lounge adjoining the dining \n> room. The dramatically backlit bar is framed by lush bronze draperies \n> that complement the room's deep-blue setting, and towering ceilings \n> give the lounge a graceful, airy ambience. Floor-to-ceiling windows \n> provide a lush panorama of the bay and the hills beyond.\n>\n>\n> Dinner at the Dining Room\n>\n> Ritz-Carlton Hotel, 600 Stockton (between Pine and\n>\n> California), 296-7465, www.ritzcarlton.com\n>\n> Your next stop on the road to beguilement is one of the handsomest \n> dining rooms in the country. The tranquil sounds of a harp underscore a \n> sumptuous setting of polished mahogany, soft linens, and fine crystal \n> gleaming in the candlelight. Chef Sylvain Portay prepares luxurious \n> nouvelle cuisine in several courses: lobster salad with caviar cream; \n> turbot with crayfish and truffles; roasted squab with port-marinated \n> figs; saffron-poached pear with guanaja chocolate gratin. Sommelier \n> Stï¿½phane Lacroix maintains a fabulous cellar, the service is impeccable \n> and inviting, and intimate discourse is practically inevitable. Next:\n>\n> Charter the Rendezvous From Rendezvous Charters\n>\n> Pier 40 (in South Beach Harbor), 543-7333,\n>\n> www.baysail.com\n>\n> Nothing's more enticing than an evening cruise around San Francisco \n> Bay, and the islands, bridges, and lights of the city are especially \n> entrancing viewed from this vintage brigantine schooner. Built in 1933 \n> and recently restored to its former glory, the 78-foot Rendezvous looks \n> like a clipper ship out of the Gold Rush era, with its 80-foot masts \n> and square-rigged sails. Intricately carved mahogany, pecan, ash, and \n> rosewood accent the brass-railed, velvet-cushioned rooms below decks, \n> the perfect spot for a sip of Veuve Cliquot and some subtle canoodling.\n>\n> Penthouse Suite at the Fairmont Hotel\n>\n> 950 Mason (between California and Sacramento),\n>\n> 772-5000, www.fairmont.com\n>\n> Last but not least, escort your companion to what has been described as \n> the most expensive hotel accommodation in the world: the Fairmont's \n> elaborate penthouse. The eight-room suite (including three bedrooms, \n> three baths, a dining room, a library, a billiard room, a fully \n> equipped kitchen, and a living room with fireplace and baby grand \n> piano) comes with its own maid, butler, and limousine and is accessed \n> by private elevator. The library alone is worth investigating: two \n> circular floors of books encapsulated by a domed ceiling etched with \n> the constellations. The view from the terrace is enthralling, and even \n> if the date's a bust you can always have a hundred people up for \n> cocktails.\n>\n> sfweekly.com | originally published: May 15, 2002\n\n\n"}
