A few years ago I caught up with\na couple of old fiancï¿½s, both now authors and notable in their\nfield.  One is a minor celebrity - perhaps I should say 'was'\nbecause fame can be so fleeting and I do not know the\ncurrent status but she still commands buck$ on the lecture\ncircuit.  I authored some technical material through the\nyears which are probably long forgotten.  I am also 'notable',\nsort of, kind of, in some very narrow fields (how many\nmando-bass artists could there be?) so have that\nfeather in my cap if I cared about it.\n\nI feel I am only a little jealous or depressed thinking about my\nown accomplishments (or lack thereof) - what does\nbug me is that these 2 probably have some real good\njuicy stories and I'm not getting to hear any of them!!\nThat's one reason I love this list...\n\n- Steve\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nforteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
