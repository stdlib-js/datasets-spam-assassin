Then they explain how: \n\n    \"Sometimes the wastebasket is exposed,\" said Joel Joves, a designer with \n    offices in Rancho Santa Fe and Beverly Hills. \"If you have a fabulous study \n    or master bedroom, then maybe we need a pewter-finished basket with \n    decorative pearl beadings or semiprecious stones to complete the look of a \n    room.\" \n\n    That's Fool Money at work. If you can't find a sufficiently fabulous \n    wastebasket for $200, $500 absolute tops, you're not half trying.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2]\n\n[1] http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/2002_10.html#001484\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/mUp57FGXT7VJ\n\n\n"}
