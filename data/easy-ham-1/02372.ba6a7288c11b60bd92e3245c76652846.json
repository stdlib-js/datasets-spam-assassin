When I confessed \n    this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. \"The FBI wouldn't \n    waste resources on that,\" he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would \n    be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel \n    illegal. Because�and this is the point of all that war-driving and \n    -chalking and node-stumbling�when you get used to wireless, the experience \n    feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe \n    bandwidth like oxygen�and arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Steven[3]!_)\n\n[1] http://www.msnbc.com/news/816606.asp\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/f5ZpuJU5975K\n[3] http://www.echonyc.com/~steven/\n\n\n"}
