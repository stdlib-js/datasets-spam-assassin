Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc.\n\nRastafari.\n\nThat is, if you concede that of the two founding branches, only the\none founded by the Nyabingi were legit and the others were\nthinly-veneered anti-colonial hooligans.  \n\nThere is also Vietnamese Buddhism, unless you count setting fire to\noneself as a \"foul action\".\n\n    S> C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but\n    S> they also aren't 'found in the wild'.\n\nYou'd have to explain \"found in the wild\".  For example, I know of\nno violence perpetrated by the South Pacific \"Cargo Cults\" outside\nof a pretty darn /mean/ game of cricket.\n\n    S> D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently\n    S> more or less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of\n    S> friction generated by splitting society too much along\n    S> religious lines.  One Post article pointed out that the problem\n    S> basically stemmed from the vertical integration of areas along\n    S> religious lines all the way to schools, government, political\n    S> party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage of British\n    S> conquest, but who doesn't?)\n\nWhen we launched the Native Net in 1989, one of the first things we\nnoticed on networking aboriginal groups around the world is that the\nBritish Army, with the US Army as a proxy by extension, were the\ncommon thread.  Where neither was present (physically or through\ninfluence) there /tended/ to be less violence.\n\nThe issue in Ireland is complex, but rest assured that religious\naspects are only a co-incidence of the invader/colonials being\npredominantly members of the Royal-headed Anglicans and the aboriginal\npopulation being predominantly members of the Pope-headed Catholics.\nThe conflict itself has nothing to do with ideology or practice, since\nthe Anglican Church is a near-identical clone of Catholicism.\n\n(now I bet that's going to attract some healthy debate ;)\n\n    S> .. most Protestants are unionists who want the\n    S> province to remain part of Britain.\n\nMebst. Mebst.  It's the other way around.  Most Unionists are protestants.\nIt's their _Unionism_ that is the source of the conflict, not their\nsacriments.\n\n    S> ... Police records and historians agree that the most lethal\n    S> group by far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a\n    S> goal of a united Ireland\n\nAnd which side of the colonial fence do you suppose the Police and\nHistorians sit?  If the Russians had invaded the USA as feared in\nepisodes such as the Bay of Pigs, would the Americans have organized\nto become a \"lethal force\", or would they have just said, \"Oh well,\nthere goes /that/ democracy!\" and settle in under communist rule?\n\nJust wondering.\n\n    >> 2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.\n\nIt is interesting to me that the Canadian media is trying to paint\nChretien as some sort of buffoon for saying that 3rd-world poverty was\na major contributor to 9-11.  If they'd /watch/ his now-infamous\ninterview, they'd see that it's still us-against-hooligans, but his\npoint is that the hooligans would not be able to find friendly states\nso easily if those states were not so bled-dry by the west.\n\nThe same is true of street-gangs: When people are disenfranchised,\nit's easier to offer them the Triad as a new family.  You get\ncellphones, cars, a dry place to live.  Triad, biker gangs, mafia, the\nIRA, Al Queda ... we've been fighting the War on Terrorism for as long\nas there's been commerce, so you'd think we'd /realize/ that\nescalation of violence is not a solution.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy - garym@teledyn.com - TeleDynamics Communications\n - blog: http://www.auracom.com/~teledyn - biz: http://teledyn.com/ -\n  \"Computers are useless.
