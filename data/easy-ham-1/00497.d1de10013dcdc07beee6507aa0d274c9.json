But it should \nbe equally clear that that isn't what people mean when they\nuse the word \"promiscuity\". \n\n> >which seems to rob it of its common meaning: \n> >activity above some specific threshold (usually \"one\") \n> \n> In that case, \"promiscous\" is a vacuous term in modern Western\n> societies (but we knew that :), where people average 7 partners or so\n> in their adult lives.\n\nNot at all. There are still people who only have one partner.\nThere are many more whoe only have one partner over \"long\"\nperiods of time. So it is far from \"vacuous\" to describe some\npeople as \"promiscuous\" and others as \"not promiscuous\", \nespecially over a set period. (\"He was promiscuous in college.\nHe is no longer promiscuous.\")\n\nThe word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency \nto gloss that meaning over with population averages. \n\n> >Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females.\n> >[...]\n> >so in this contrived population, females are more \"promiscuous\" than males,\n> \n> So 1 girl gets 1 guy, 2 girls get 2 guys, 2 guys get 1 girl, 1 guy\n> gets 3 girls.

Then, 1 man, let's call him \"Wilt\",\nalso has sex with the other 499,999 women. \n\n499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have\nonly had one partner. It is now \"perfectly obvious\" that in the\ncommon meaning of the term, among this contrived population, \nthat women are \"more promiscuous\" than men -- even though the\nsingle \"most promiscuous\" person, Wilt, is a man.  \n\n\"Promiscuity\" is not \"exactly, perfectly identical between males \nand females\", except under a degenerate custom definition of\n\"promiscuity\".\n\n> >unless \"promiscuity\" is defined uselessly.\n> \n> Ain't nothin' useless about averages.\n\nAverages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their \nactual name, rather than conflated with another concept.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n"}
