And the bandwidth shadows in most cities\nare surprisingly large and common.  They aren't selling the software, which\nis pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next\ngeneration wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large\nscale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless\nconfigurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and\nothers which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit\nconsiderations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize\nthe canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless\nis tied into fiber at multiple points.\n\nThe canopies we are talking about aren't short-range wifi technologies, but\na mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth\nmeasured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to\nwell over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and\nbandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an\norder of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and\nproximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the\ncost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers\ncan remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low\nbar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of\nlarge-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective\nbandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company's\nlong-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to\nkeep things sane.\n\nOr at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,\nespecially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the\nsystem (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more\nefficient).\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n"}
