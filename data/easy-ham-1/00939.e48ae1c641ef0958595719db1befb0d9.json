Uppity barbarians overly\n   fond of \"risings\".  Scots?  More uppity\n   barbarians overly fond of \"risings\".\n   Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter\n   next to the former and kill two birds\n   with one stone?\n\nIsrael:  Ex-ottomans?  Uppity barbarians\n   (didn't they help kick out the Ottomans?)\n   Zionists?  Uppity sorts who aren't happy\n   with perfectly good land in Uganda.  Why\n   not plonk down a bunch of the latter next\n   to the former and kill two birds with one\n   stone?\n\nbut not:\n\nIndia: in which the muslims and hindus were\n    originally intermixed to some degree,\n    but Partioned due to their own conflict,\n    not due to English resettlement policy.\n\nCanada: in which the french and english were\n    already established, and it was just the\n    balance of power on the continent that\n    determined events in the colonies.  The\n    Acadians got resettled, but they don't\n    seem to have been that good for picking\n    fights with their neighbors, so no one\n    had them plonked down next door.\n\n-Dave\n\n* this works best with a populace who,\ngiven \"one man, one vote\", immediately\ndeduce \"one less man, one less vote\" --\neh, Magnan?\n\n\n"}
