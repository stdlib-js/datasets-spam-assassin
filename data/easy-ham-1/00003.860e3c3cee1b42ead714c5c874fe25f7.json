No other details\nwere immediately available.\nThe man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and\nITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to\ntalk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nPolice and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within\nblocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the\nman, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news\nagencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside\nthe building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.\nThe man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove\nto a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held\nfurther negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The\nmove appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more\nsecure location. \n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
