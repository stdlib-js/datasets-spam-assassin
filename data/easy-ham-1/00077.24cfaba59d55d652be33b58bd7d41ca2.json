Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes\nthat \"criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to\npreserve the viability of America's content industries.\" Malcolm also\nbelieves that people who trade copyrighted material think they are\nparticipating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download\ncopyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions\nsuch as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see\nbusinesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of\ncopyrighted works.\n\n\n\"Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think\nthey would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal\nprosecution,\" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same\nconference panel.\n\nI'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is\nhoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or\nwarnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor\ndeterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits\ncarrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate\nfurther animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to\ninitiate because of the \"schooling\" effect of millions of systems\nparticipating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from\nthe crowd.\n\nThe article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines\nillegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:\n\n\nCriminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for\npurposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the\nreproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any\n180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more\ncopyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....\nFor purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution\nof a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish\nwillful infringement.\n...\nThe term \"financial gain\" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of\nanything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.\n\n\nTherefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as \"financial gain\"\neven if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the\nvalue of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15\nto millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the\nperspective of the consumer or copyright holder.\n\nThe statute of limitations:\n\n\n507. Limitations on actions\n\n(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained\nunder the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five\nyears after the cause of action arose.\n\n(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the\nprovisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after\nthe claim accrued.\n\nThe penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in\nSection 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time\ncriminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.\n\nI'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to\nprosecute because of the aforementioned \"schooling\" effect, but my guess\nwould be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent\nindividuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be\ntargeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers.
