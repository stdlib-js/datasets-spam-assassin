The new\narchbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the\nchurch.\nNevertheless, the society said: \"It is clear that he prefers his private\njudgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the\ncommon mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.\n\"The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan\nWilliams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand\ndown,\" it said.\nThe society claimed to have drawn up an \"action plan,\" including calling on\nbishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of\nwhich archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from\nDr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be\n\"taking steps towards appropriate direct action\".\nIt added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal\ncalled Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles\nallegedly commending homosexual behaviour.\nDespite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the\nchurch. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown\nappointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his\nappointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.\nHe is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be\nformally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.\nAsked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the\nsociety's chairman, said: \"Watch this space.\" Presumably it could involve a\nsmall minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking\nalternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams\nis present.\nChurch of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down\nduring the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the\nevangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the\nabsence of a robust rebuttal.\nA letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the\nevangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical\nteaching.\nOn the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of\nWestcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption\nand blackmail. \"It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is\nattempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get\nyour way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,\" she said.\nLast week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. \"Matters of sexuality\nshould not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church\nSociety have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his\nappointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take\nthe post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.\"\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
