Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of\nthis continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even\nfor descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents\nof slaves, who were brought here by force.\n\nMore stuff, cheaper. That's progress.\n\nPoverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in\nwealth has nothing to do with it.\n\nIt's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only\nindividuals do. Like group rights, \"disparity\" in wealth is\nstatistical sophistry.\n\n\nBesides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth\nis almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when\nthere are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes\n400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there\nsince 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on\nwealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,\nthey're nowhere near the top.\n\nI'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,\nin the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated\nmonopoly, corporate welfare, \"non-profit\" neoaristocratic tax dodges,\nand legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like\nwhat happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.\n\nIn fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most \"unfairly\"\ndistributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --\neconomic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more\npeople living longer.\n\nI'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the\nreturns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPYy3ysPxH8jf3ohaEQLqNQCg14YvF8NVYwKiRrghHdisBoNCOn8AoPcR\nQUzorXeaLe5h3T1syKl7DFNT\n=9kff\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
