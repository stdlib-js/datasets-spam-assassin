From what I've read, the the\nchoices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.\nIt seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which\nis a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is\nsomewhat simpler to setup. \n\nThe problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites\nrun OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of\nIPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.\n\nSo, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a\nsignificant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?\nIf CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever\non the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote\nsites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity\nin software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.\n\n\n\nNiall\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
