Part of my cunning plan involves something like this:\n\n  if folder == \"accepted\":             # ie. not suspected junk mail\n      if (len(recipients) == 1 and\n          recipients[0] in (\"guido@python.org\", \"barry@python.org\", ...)):\n          folder = \"personal\"\n\nIf you (and Guido, Barry, et. al.) prefer, I could change that last\nstatement to \"folder = None\", so the mail won't be saved at all.  I\n*might* also add a \"and sender doesn't look like -bounce-*, -request,\n-admin, ...\" clause to that if statement.\n\n> Can you think of anyplace to get a large, shareable ham sample apart from a\n> public mailing list?

If that\nsounds vague, it matches my level of understanding.\n\n        Greg\n-- \nGreg Ward <gward@python.net>                         http://www.gerg.ca/\nReality is for people who can't handle science fiction.\n"}
