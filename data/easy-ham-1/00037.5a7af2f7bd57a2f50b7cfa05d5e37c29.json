Bush proclaimed, \"The problem with\nthe French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.\"\n\n\nOrigins:   Yet another French fried \"George W. Bush is dumb\"\nstory has been taken up by those who like their caricatures\ndrawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that\nemerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,\nBritain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President\nJacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,\nthe decline of the French economy. \"The problem with the\nFrench,\" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, \"is that they don't\nhave a word for entrepreneur.\"\n\nThe source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness\nWilliams of Crosby, who claimed \"my good friend Tony Blair\" had\nrecently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.\n\nLloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness\nWilliams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did\nreceive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of\ncommunications and strategy. \"I can tell you that the prime\nminister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly\nnever told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,\"\nCampbell told The Post. \"If she put this in a speech, it must\nhave been a joke.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of\na jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than\nstellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories\ntoo hard, we can come up with three other instances we've\nchronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the\nmoment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the\nranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged\nas the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the\nintelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus\nquatrain which pontificated that the \"village idiot\" would win\nthe 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it\nwas the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks\nto chortling up their sleeves.\n\nStories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual\nshortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they\nseemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this\npublic figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever\nbeen. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at\nsome level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always\nfall upon appreciative ears.\n\nBarbara \"ears of corn\" Mikkelson\n\nLast updated:   29 July 2002\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
