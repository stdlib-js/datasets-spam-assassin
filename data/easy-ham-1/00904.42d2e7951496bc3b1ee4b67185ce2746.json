Sometimes the \npeople I talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me \nthat the phone number doesn't exist. Some people are able to locate the \naccount but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we \ncould get a bill sent to us for that account. Some people can locate the \naccount and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years \nand that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the \nlines of \"Huh?\" or \"I'm not sure what's going on... Hold please.\" And \neventually I have similar conversations with their managers and the \naccount representatives and billing people and their managers and their \nmanagers' managers ad naseum.\n\nThe outcome of every phone call is that they'll \"look into it\" and fix \nthe problem and I might receive one or two more bills depending on when \nit's resolved. So I wait a month or two and send the bills back marked \n\"Not at this address, please fsck off.\" and then eventually call them \nback and go through the whole process again. Lately I just explain to \nthe phone jockeys that I know it's not their fault and I'm not mad at \nthem and it's just not their day because I'm about to give them hell. \nThen I give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which \nthey seem all too happy to do.\n\nAt least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it's a \nlot cheaper than seeing a therapist.\n\nPerplexed,\nElias\n\n\nbitbitch@magnesium.net wrote:\n\n>\n>So I get a check from Pac Bell today (SBC as they're called now).\n>Turns out, they went to the trouble of printing out, signing, sealing\n>and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole $0.33.\n>\n>[...]\n>\n\n\n\n"}
