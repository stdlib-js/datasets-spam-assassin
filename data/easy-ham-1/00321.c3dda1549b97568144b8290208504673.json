I *do* care about content.  Hell,\nif I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth\nall day, I'd have a different opinion of this.  I just am not convinced\nthat they will (stupid or not).\n\nWhile a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same\nargument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who\ncommunicate by pictures?  Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is\nsuch an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find\nyourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?\n\nI don't buy it.\n\nFor most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient\nmechanism.  For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not\nnearly as often as words.  Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and\nsuch are games?  Because images are usually not the most efficient way to\nget a message across.\n\n>misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same\n>thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better\n>resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the\nplant\n>had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital\ncamera,\n>and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of\n>decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the\n>photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS\n>didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its\n>greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS\n>traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,\n>SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.\n\nAgain, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with \"you just\ndon't understand kids today, and they'll run with this\").  I wasn't saying\nthat MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't\neasy.  I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way\nthat \"changed the face of communications\".\n\nI'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why\npeople would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the\nphone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see\npeople taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to\nother people.  But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over\nsending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or\noffline) photoalbum.\n\nI don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics\nright away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That's\none of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant\nview part.  I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want\n\"instant view\", but also \"instant show\".  Which is what this service\noffers.  I'm not convinced that most people want \"instant show\".  I think\npeople like to package their pictures and show them.  That's why people put\ntogether fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while\nthey explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally \"instant show\" is nice, but\nit's just \"nice\" on occasion.  I still can't see how it becomes a integral\nmessaging method.\n\nWhat's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it\nfrom one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's\nsilly if people are going to flock to it.\n\nI'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.\n\nThe *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately\nare Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event\nwill happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile\nphones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of\nwhat happened - before the press even gets there.\n\nWilling to be proven wrong,\nMike\n\nPS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as\nthey currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
