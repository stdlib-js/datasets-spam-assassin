Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning\n> FreeBSD 4.4.

(This\n> paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph\n> above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)\n>\n> At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email\n> processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,\n> perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?\n>\n> Any ideas would be welcome.\n>\n> Thanks,\n> Joe\n> ---\n> Joe Berry\n> joe@topshot.com\n> AIM \"joe topshot\"\n> Yahoo Msgr \"joetopshot\"\n> jabber \"joetopshot@topshot.com\"\n> Baltimore, MD\n>\n>\n>\n> -------------------------------------------------------\n> This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\n> cell phone?
