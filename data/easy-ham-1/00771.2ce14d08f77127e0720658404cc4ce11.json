I'm afraid I don't understand how the transmission\nprices could have hit $50/tcf.\n\nBut I'm also really leery of telling a pipeline company they have to run\na pipeline at a higher pressure and that they should forego maintenance.\nWe had a big pipeline explosion up here awhile ago.\n\nSo maybe the judge has a point.
