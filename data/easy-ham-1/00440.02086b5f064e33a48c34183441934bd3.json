His 'thumbs of death'\nwould rival anything a toddler could do to devices.  After countless numbers of\nWalkman devices having their lids broken or buttons pressed into oblivion I\nfound the Sony devices.  I got him a \"My First Sony\" (be afraid of the\nmarketing) CD player.   It was /fire engine red/ but was completely\nindestructible.  I hacked a headphone jack into it and gave it to him.  He\ncomplained of it's looks but used it nonetheless.  I also gave him a pack of\nheadphones as there's no such things indestuctible headphones that aren't\nobscenely bulky.\n\nNow that we're riding up the curve of an ever increasing geezer population, how\nsoon before device makers get wise?  Not to be morbid, but would the marketing\nbe \"My Last Sony\"?  <ducks and runs>\n\n-Bill Kearney\n\n"}
