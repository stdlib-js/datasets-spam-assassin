I'm not a math geek or anything, but\nassuming 1 lover every day, that would be like at least one lover\neveryday for 8 years and some change.   I don't know about you, but\nvery very few of us are -that- lucky (or even close to that lucky)\nand after awhile, even the sexaholics get bored and have to mingle\nsomething new into their weekends.   You really are assumiing that the\nhomosexual population is a) that large in a given area (The meccas\nmight qualify, but try finding that kind of homosexual population in\nsay, Tulsa, Oklahoma or Manchester, NH (Tho Manchester does have quite\na few nifty gaybars, but thats a different story)  b) that bored/sex\nobsessed/recreationally free to pursue sex that often, with that many\npartners or that they'd even WANT that many partners.\n\nQualify yourself, or at least lower your outrageous numbers.\n\n=BB\n>> are promiscuous, and so are hets, but I betcha gays are more\n>> AIDSphobic than hets, generally speaking....\n\nEL> The virus load issue is orthogonal to the fact.
