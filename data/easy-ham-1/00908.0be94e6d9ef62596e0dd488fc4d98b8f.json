If you mean\nsplitting countries upon arbitrary lines and assigning different groups \nto opposite sides of the line, it also seems to have not worked in\nIndia/Pakistan.\nI suppose Canada, which is supposed to be a \"loose confederation\" of 2 \nfounding nations (French and English) can be cited as a success. The \njury is still out, but so far only a few brief rebellions and \nreferendums and such, still together after 130+ years.\n\nOwen\n\n\n\n"}
