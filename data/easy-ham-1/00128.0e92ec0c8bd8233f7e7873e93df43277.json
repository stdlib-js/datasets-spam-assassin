If it's less, the combined total amount will go to the city as\nlump sum settlement.\n\nin your case, maybe all the customers could vote on line where they'd like\ntheir lump sum to go.  of courese, they'd have to be notified by mail first.\n:-)\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com]On Behalf Of John\nHall\nSent: Monday, October 07, 2002 5:02 PM\nTo: Fork@xent.com\nSubject: RE: The absurdities of life.\n\n\nThey are legally required to do that.  I got a similar check because an\ninsurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been\n$.02.\n\nAlthough they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the\nalternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies\nto have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they\ncould keep it?
