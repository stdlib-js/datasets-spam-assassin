Though perhaps ordering a free Enron mug\nas the King of Hell....\n\nI think it's like P3P met whatever commercial /.like forum was rocking\nyesterday, and they took all Greg's extra serotonin and lit up and\nmade a Successful go of personal address palettes you could occupy and\nown or rent and even move or sell.  So you'd reply to all the whitepaper\nsites you wouldn't just call to get the real deal like: 'Okay, let's say\nI'm in Factorytown, GuangZhou, and I'm a battery acid supervisor for\na multinational that sometimes buys B1s.  e-mail me if you get your story\nwritten up all the way;' or\n\t'Today, I'm a 200lb, 3m tall mophead with pearlecent teeth\nand excellent sex-linked features, but who uses Solaris nntp clients.  Got it?'\n or merely\n\t'I can't read Base64 messages.  I use small alphabets and\n8-letter words that didn't come from the bible and use calculus, and\nI'd thank you to class me as a Catamite.'\n\n&> Yes, but this is what normally happened:\n&> Engineer: we can put an input validator/parser on the backend to do that.\n&> \t.....\n&> Creative Director: I don't give a shit.
