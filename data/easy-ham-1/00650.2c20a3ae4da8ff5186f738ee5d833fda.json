It is first recorded as being used by Captain \nFrederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: \"I won't thrash you Tom. \nShiver my timbers if I do\".\n\nIt has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years \nlater Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt \nsaying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure \nIsland/: \"Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before \nyou ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, \nand all to feed the fishes\". Since then, it's mainly been the preserve \nof second-rate seafaring yarns.\n\n\n\n"}
