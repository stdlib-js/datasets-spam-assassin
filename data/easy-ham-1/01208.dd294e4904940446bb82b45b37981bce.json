That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they \nsure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your \nown.\n\nsecond, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means \"so much has been \nchanged that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release \nanyway\".  So, historically, most users installing a .0 release do this \nfrom scratch anyway, doing upgrades throughout x.0->x.y.\n\nIf you want to avoid problems, bite the bullet and reinstall ;)\n\nThomas\n\n -- \n\nThe Dave/Dina Project : future TV today ! - http://davedina.apestaart.org/\n<-*-                      -*->\nAnd every time she sneezes\nI think it's love and oh lord\nI'm not ready for this sort of thing\n<-*- thomas@apestaart.org -*->\nURGent, the best radio on the Internet - 24/7 ! - http://urgent.rug.ac.be/\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
