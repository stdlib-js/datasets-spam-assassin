However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint\n> state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current\n> folder on every message read?  Perhaps we look at the sequences file\n> more than once per message view?  \n\nAs I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences file \nfirst to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence.  This \nhappens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in Ftoc_ShowSequences.\nThat seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my abstraction to \nhave a separate call for \"what sequences are in this folder?\" and \"what \nmessages are in this sequence?\".  One option would have been to add another \ncall to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the check-the-modify-time \ntechnique would be less error-prone.\n\nI think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to allow \na finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the \ncurrent code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences \nfor all messages.  I described these thoughts in an email message yesterday.\n\nAnd again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.\n\nChris\n\n-- \nChris Garrigues                 http://www.DeepEddy.Com/~cwg/\nvirCIO                          http://www.virCIO.Com\n716 Congress, Suite 200\nAustin, TX  78701\t\t+1 512 374 0500\n\n  World War III:  The Wrong-Doers Vs. the Evil-Doers.\n\n\n\n\n--==_Exmh_948625160P\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Exmh version 2.2_20000822 06/23/2000\n\niD8DBQE9bijoK9b4h5R0IUIRApBEAJ9XB23cpckpVw7zWH/Uk1cG6rMCmQCfcNN9\n6I86NmGOWTSr1zajO3HHPnA=\n=sApX\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n--==_Exmh_948625160P--\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n"}
