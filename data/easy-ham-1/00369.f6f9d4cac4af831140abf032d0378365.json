Redhat of course doesnt count as\nportable either, but it's nice they are trying. The Windows I/O model does\ndefinately blow the doors off the UNIX one, but then they had select to\npoint at in it's suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX\nis just now looking at it's I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess\nmultithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API comes out\nof it. Bottom line is the \"do stuff when something happens\" model turned out\nto be right, and the UNIX \"look for something to do and keep looking till\nyou find it no matter how many times you have to look\" is not really working\nso great anymore.\n\n- Adam L. \"Duncan\" Beberg\n  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/\n  beberg@mithral.com\n\n\n"}
