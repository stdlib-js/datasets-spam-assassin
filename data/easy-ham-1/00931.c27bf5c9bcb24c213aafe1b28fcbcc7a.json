Unlike competing solutions that \nprocess XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in \nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \naccording to company officials.\n\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a \nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The \nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \ndata.\n\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \nbusinesses.\n\n\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \n\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\n\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \nalternative.\n\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \nimportance in the world of XML.\n\n\"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \nsaid. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \nFirewalls are blind to XML today.\"\n\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company \nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n\n\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \nadding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \nwill be mostly false.\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, \nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes \nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of \nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \nas they pass through the device.\n\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application \nco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \ncontrols the device.\n\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \nSarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in \nMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \nfocus on content processing and acceleration.\nThe DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The \ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \nfield trails at a number of other enterprises.\n\n=========================================================================\n\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \nwould have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML \ngrew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \ndesigned the industry's first solutions to address the unique \nrequirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software \ninterpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing \nis still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.\n\nLeveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \ndeveloping software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar \nand designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In \n2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3�), the \nindustry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\n\nToday, XG3� technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML \nnetwork devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \nServices. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of \nproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, \nproviding an immediate return on technology investments to \nindustry-leading customers and partners.\n\nDataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that \nbrings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, \ndrawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including \nAkamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.\n\n=========================================================================\n\nDataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding\n\nVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer \nin XML-Aware Networking for Web Services\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the \nleading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced \nthat it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for \nthis round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed \nCapital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, \nand Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower�s Board of \nDirectors.\n\nDataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and \nsales of the company�s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. \nFounded in 1999, DataPower invented the world�s first intelligent XML \nnetworking�devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions \nat the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services \nand other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower�s solutions are based on \nits patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3�) technology.\n\n\"Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and \nintra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill \nprepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. \nDataPower�s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of \nXML that is required to support next generation enterprise \napplications,\" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower \nTechnology.\n\n\"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that�s critical to Web \nservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance.\" A single \nDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 \nservers�breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML \nprocessing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In \naddition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, \nprotection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of \ne-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing \nbetween back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.\n\n\"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require \nlaser-focused scrutiny. DataPower�s patent-pending technology addresses \na very real and growing pain point for enterprises,\" said Michael \nTyrrell of Venrock Associates. \"By turbo-charging their networks with \nDataPower�s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be \nfree to adopt next generation Web services without encountering \nperformance and security pitfalls.\"\n\n\"We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly \ngrowing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and \nsecurity,\" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. \"DataPower is on \ntheir third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML \nGeneration Three (XG3)�technology was quite simply the single most \ncompelling technology solution we have seen to date.\"\n\n\"XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious \nabout optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been \ndeveloping solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web \nservices,\" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. \"DataPower�s \nXML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely \non XML for mission critical applications.\"\n\nAbout Venrock Associates\nVenrock Associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the \nRockefeller Family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs \nthat now spans over seven decades.
