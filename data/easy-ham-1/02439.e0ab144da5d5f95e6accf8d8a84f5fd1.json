Another search engine \n(can't remember which one tho') was doing this a long time ago.\n\nhttp://www.bangkokpost.com/Business/02Dec2002_biz54.html\n\n=====\nPostcards from Planet Google\n\nINTERNET: The search engine is taking snapshots of its users' minds and \naggregating them. So what is the world thinking about?\n\nJENNIFER 8. LEE\n\nAt Google's squat headquarters off Route 101, visitors sit in the lobby, \ntransfixed by the words scrolling by on the wall behind the \nreceptionist's desk: animacio{AAC}n japonese Harry Potter pense{AAC}es \net poemes associao brasileira de normas te{AAC}cnicas.\n\nThe projected display, called Live Query, shows updated samples of what \npeople around the world are typing into Google's search engine. The \nterms scroll by in English, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Japanese, Korean, \nFrench, Dutch, Italian _ any of the 86 languages that Google tracks.\n\nThe scrolling continues: people who shouldn't marry ``she smoked a \ncigar'' mr potatoheads in long island pickup lines to get women auto \ntheft fraud how to.\n\nStare at Live Query long enough, and you feel you are watching the \ncollective consciousness of the world stream by.\n\nEach line represents a thought from someone, somewhere with an Internet \nconnection. Google collects these queries _ 150 million a day from more \nthan 100 countries _ in its databases, updating and storing the computer \nlogs millisecond by millisecond.\n\nGoogle is taking snapshots of its users' minds and aggregating them.\n\nSo what is the world thinking about?\n\nSex, for one thing.\n\n``You can learn to say `sex' in a lot of different languages by looking \nat the logs,'' said Craig Silverstein, director of technology at Google. \n(To keep Live Query G-rated, Google filters out sex-related searches, \nthough less successfully with foreign languages.)\n\nDespite its geographic and ethnic diversity, the world is spending much \nof its time thinking about the same things. The same topic areas bubble \nto the top: celebrities, current events, products and computer downloads.\n\n``It's amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what \nthey are searching for,'' said Greg Rae, one of three members of \nGoogle's logs team, which is responsible for building, storing and \nprotecting the data record.\n\nGoogle's following _ it is the most widely used search engine _ has \ngiven Mr Rae a worldview from his cubicle. Since October 2001, he has \nbeen able to reel off ``anthrax'' in several languages, including \nmilzbrand in German and carbonchio in Italian. He says he can also tell \nwhich countries took their recent elections seriously (Brazil and \nGermany), because of the frenzy of searches. He notes that the \nglobalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are \nfar-flung in origin: Nokia, Sony, BMW, Ferrari, Ikea and Microsoft.\n\nJudging from Google's data, some sports events stir interest almost \neverywhere: the Tour de France, Wimbledon, the Melbourne Cup horse race \nand the World Series were among the top 10 sports-related searches last \nyear. It also becomes obvious just how familiar American movies, music \nand celebrities are to searchers across the globe. Two years ago, a \nGoogle engineer named Lucas Pereira noticed that searches for Britney \nSpears had declined, indicating what he thought must be a decline in her \npopularity. From that observation grew Google Zeitgeist, a listing of \nthe top gaining and declining queries of each week and month.\n\nGlancing over Google Zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural \nliteracy: Ulrika Jonsson, the Swedish-born British television host and \ngirlfriend of England football coach Sven Goran Eriksson, made the list \nrecently. So did Irish Travellers (a nomadic ethnic group, one of whose \nmembers was videotaped beating her young daughter in Indiana) and \nfentanyl (the narcotic gas used in the Moscow raid to rescue hostages \ntaken by Chechen rebels in late October).\n\nThe long-lasting volume of searches involving her name has made Britney \nSpears something of a benchmark for the logs team. It has helped them \nunderstand how news can cause spikes in searches, as it did when she \nbroke up with Justin Timberlake.\n\nGoogle can feel the reverberations of such events, and others of a more \nserious nature, immediately.\n\nOn Feb 28, 2001, for example, an earthquake began near Seattle at 10:54 \nam local time. Within two minutes, earthquake-related searches jumped to \n250 a minute from almost none, with a concentration in the US Pacific \nNorthwest. On Sept 11, searches for the World Trade Center, Pentagon and \nCNN shot up immediately after the attacks. Over the next few days, \nNostradamus became the top search query, fuelled by a rumour that \nNostradamus had predicted the trade center's destruction.\n\nBut the most trivial events may also register on Google's sensitive \ncultural seismic meter.\n\nThe logs team came to work one morning to find that ``carol brady maiden \nname'' had surged to the top of the charts.\n\nCurious, they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they \nwere neatly grouped in five spikes, each one starting at 48 minutes \nafter the hour.\n\nAs the logs were passed through the office, employees were perplexed. \nWhy would there be a surge in interest in a character from the 1970s \nsitcom The Brady Bunch? But the data could only reflect patterns, not \nexplain them.\n\nThat is a paradox of a Google log: it does not capture social phenomena \nper se, but merely the shadows they cast across the Internet.\n\n``The most interesting part is why,'' said Amit Patel, who has been a \nmember of the logs team. ``You can't interpret it unless you know what \nelse is going on in the world.''\n\nSo what had gone on on April 22, 2001?\n\nThat night the million-dollar question on the game show Who Wants to Be \na Millionaire? had been, ``What was Carol Brady's maiden name?'' Seconds \nafter the show's host posed the question, thousands flocked to Google to \nsearch for the answer (Tyler), producing four spikes as the show was \nbroadcast successively in each US time zone.\n\nThe precision of the Carol Brady data was eye-opening for some.\n\n``It was like trying an electron microscope for the first time,'' said \nSergey Brin, who as a graduate student in computer science at Stanford \nhelped found Google in 1998 and is now its president for technology. \n``It was like a moment-by-moment barometer.''\n\nPredictably, Google's query data respond to television, movies and \nradio. But the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences. \nOne of Google's strengths is its predictive power, flagging trends \nbefore they hit the radar of other media.\n\nAs such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or \nretailers. Google is quiet about what if any plans it has for \ncommercialising its vast store of query information. ``There is \ntremendous opportunity with this data,'' Mr Silverstein said. ``The \nchallenge is defining what we want to do.''\n\nGoogle currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data \nbecause of privacy concerns. Searches are logged by time of day, \noriginating IP address (information that can be used to link searches to \na specific computer), and the sites on which the user clicked. People \ntell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly \n_ Viagra, pregnancy scares, fraud, facelifts. What is interesting in the \naggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an individual.\n\nIn aggregate form, Google's data can make a stunning presentation. Next \nto Mr Rae's cubicle is the GeoDisplay, a 40-inch screen that gives a \nthree-dimensional geographical representation of where Google is being \nused around the globe. The searches are represented by coloured dots \nshooting into the atmosphere. The colours _ red, yellow, orange _ convey \nthe impression of a globe whose major cities are on fire. The tallest \nflames are in New York, Tokyo and the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nEach country has a distinctive usage pattern. Spain, France and Italy \nhave a midday lull in Google searches, presumably reflecting leisurely \nlunches and relaxation. In Japan, the peak usage is after midnight, when \nphone rates for dial-up modems drop.\n\nGoogle's worldwide scope means that the company can track ideas and \nphenomena as they hop from country to country.\n\nTake Las Ketchup, a trio of singing sisters who became a sensation in \nSpain last spring with a gibberish song and accompanying knee-knocking \ndance similar to the Macarena.\n\nLike a series of waves, Google searches for Las Ketchup undulated \nthrough Europe over the summer and fall.\n\nThe Ketchup Song (Hey Hah) has already topped the charts in 18 \ncountries. In late summer, Google's logs show, Las Ketchup searches \nbegan a strong upward climb in the United States, Britain and the \nNetherlands.\n\nHaven't heard of Las Ketchup?\n\nIf you haven't, Google predicts you soon will.\n===\n\nrgrds,\nBernard\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nIIU mailing list\nIIU@iiu.taint.org\nhttp://iiu.taint.org/mailman/listinfo/iiu\n\n\n"}
