What the WSJ said, appended below.\n\n\nThe WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,\nexpropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at\nthe behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the \"good\"\nof the city, and owned by an \"authority\" looking for something else\nto do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized\ncrime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest\nnation.\n\nNow, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago\nhave been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally\nirrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in\ngovernment.\n\nAs a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly\nusable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will\nbe \"granted\" away  in a potlatch that only government, and\nspecial-interest \"communities\", (or \"stakeholders\", or whatever the\ncryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize\nto such perfection.\n\n\nAll this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded\nby a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not\nreligious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name.\n*Commerce*.\n\n\nIf they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites\nwho collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects\non a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called\n\"authority\" should disband itself and sell its property off to the\nhighest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,\nforeign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.\n\nIf the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for\na memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the\nfamilies of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the\nproperty, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the\nevent.\n\nAnd, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as\ntall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square\nfeet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.\n\n\nIn these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic\ninternetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially\ndecreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,\neconomics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition\nand statism.\n\nIt's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower\nManhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but\nit's going to happen sooner or later.\n\nAnd, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who\ndied at the World Trade Center.\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n\n- -------\n\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB1031705210159756235,00.html\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nSeptember 11, 2002\nREVIEW & OUTLOOK\n\nA Living Memorial\n\nAs we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the\nsix-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone\nelse, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who\ndied a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who\nperished would be a living one.\n\nThe site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,\nespecially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of\nheroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of\nthe enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were\nattacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best\nexpression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be\nto once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries\nworking, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of\nproductive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin\nLaden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.\n\nBut restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has\nbeen about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous\nrebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the\nTrade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and\nscale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now\nclamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership,\nand its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance\nto rebuild a better, more prosperous city.\n\nThis is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out\nwhat to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor\nGeorge Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November\nre-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the\nmemorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the\ncommission would have been better off setting aside a limited space\nfor the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning\nto the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so\nsuccessfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for\nan outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.\n\nA big part of the problem in New York is that the city's\nanti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They\nwant the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas\n- -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have\nhad plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in\nNew York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World\nTrade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are\ncynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own\nanti-development agenda in the name of \"honoring\" the dead. One\nfamily group even called a press conference to reject as\ndisrespectful a proposed train line under the site.\n\nWe are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident\nthat a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center\nisn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great\ncities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all\nrebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban\nlife. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port\ncity reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a\nstatue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.\n\nIn this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to\nbe inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were\naffiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,\nyou'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary\nWar, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World\nWar I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it\ndisrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on\naround the walls containing their names.\n\nIn New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the\nemotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future.\nRudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres\ndevoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures\non the \"footprints,\" which, being in the center of the site, would\nseverely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised\nhis voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the\npress and has since ducked for cover.\n\nMaybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe\nthose responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking\nmore about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best\nway to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPX9zD8PxH8jf3ohaEQI2aACgv7mtb5VKTpRj5MJQt1OyzyifzusAn273\nfgNkOntna6+SmLO8TB4XYbC2\n=09az\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
