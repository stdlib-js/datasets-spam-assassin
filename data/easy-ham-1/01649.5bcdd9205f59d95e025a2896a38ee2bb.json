Assuming very little spam comes through, we\nonly need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training\nham to match the new training spam.  The program could randomly select\na sufficient number of saved non-spam msgs and ask the user to\nvalidate this selection.  You could do this once a day or week (config\nparameter).\n\n> How many spams-as-hams can be accepted before the f-n rate gets\n> unacceptable?\n\nConfig parameter.\n\n> I view IMAP as a stop-gap measure until tighter integration with\n> various email clients can be achieved.\n> \n> I still feel it's better to require classification feedback from the\n> recipient, rather than make any assumptions after some period of\n> time passes.
