A little orange\nLED comes on when I plug her in but that's it, after some googling\nI found some reference to re-seating all the parts, but no change.\nThe problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dell\nspecific one, ATX block with what looks like one of the old AT\npower connectors, I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo prob\nor a PSU prob. Just to futily try and drag this back OT, I want\nto install Linux on it when I get it working. If anyone knows\nwhat the problem might be give me a shout.\n\nCheers,\nPeter.\n\n--\nPeter Aherne, Software Engineer, \nMotorola Ireland Ltd.\nPh: +353 21 4511234 Mobile: +353 87 2246834\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
