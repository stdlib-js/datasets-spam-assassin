I haven't done anything to try to reduce its\nsize, and know of some specific problem areas (for example, doing character\n5-grams of \"long words\" containing high-bit characters generates a lot of\ndatabase entries, and I suspect they're approximately worthless).  OTOH,\nadding in more headers will increase the size.  So let's call it 10 meg\n<wink>.\n\n"}
