He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow\nand a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a\nsemi-circle of darker sky.\n\nI know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't\nrecall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of\nthings are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm\nsorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on\natmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.\n\nBill\n\nWilliam Jacobs\nFreelance Unemployed Person\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
