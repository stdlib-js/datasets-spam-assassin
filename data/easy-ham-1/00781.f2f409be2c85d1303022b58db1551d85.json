In a number of cases, CO2 level increases\n> are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the\n> increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature\n> preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done\n> of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are\n> correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly\n> causative.\n\nBased on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation\nbetween temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to\nbe causal.\n\n> With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to\n> point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly\n> regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.\n\nAlso correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2.\n\n> As it\n> happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous\n> cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data.\n\nNot correct. Mauna Loa data <http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/06.htm> and\n<http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp001/maunaloa.co2> show that the current CO2\nconcentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded\nvalue from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing\nat 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the\nVostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine\nresolution).\n\n> In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels,\n\nNo, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart:\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm\n(Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the \"historical record\").\n\nNot only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok\nrecord, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing.\nThere is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for\nanthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debating\nthis -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.\n\n> but it looks a lot like we\n> would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical\n> record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2\n> concentrations.\n\nWrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past\n400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly\nspike, and then return back to \"normal\" background levels (and hence the\nspike might not show up in the ice cores).\n\nStill, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that\neven you would have a hard time arguing away.\n\n> Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately\n> affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely\n> predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative\n> feedback systems mentioned above.\n\nYes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a\nfinite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase,\nbut we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be\nenormous.\n\n> Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it\n> makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and\n> methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule\n> basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something\n> that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the\n> biosphere.\n\nCorrect.\n\nData on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses:\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htm\n\nNote that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial\nlevels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also\na contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly\nanthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I'm in favor of reductions in\nmethane levels as well.\n\nData on water vapor here:\nhttp://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html\n\n> CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent\n> studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a\n> passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.\n\nI tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in\nreducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar,\nwind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources\nof C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense\n(burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve\nreductions in lifestyle to a \"sustainable\" level are unrealistic --\nAmericans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate\nchange researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last\nyear's energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and\nimproved efficiency is an easy sell.\n\n- Jim\n\n\n"}
