It would be wonderful to get\nseveral people cranking on the same test data, and I'm all in favor of that.\nOTOH, my Data/ subtree currently has more than 35,000 files slobbering over\n134 million bytes -- even if I had a place to put that much stuff, I'm not\nsure my ISP would let me email it in one msg <wink>.\n\nApart from that, there was a mistake very early on whose outcome was that\nthis isn't the data I hoped I was using.  I *hoped* I was using a snapshot\nof only recent msgs (to match the snapshot this way of only spam from 2002),\nbut turns out they actually go back to the last millennium.  Greg Ward is\ncurrently capturing a stream coming into python.org, and I hope we can get a\nmore modern, and cleaner, test set out of that.  But if that stream contains\nany private email, it may not be ethically possible to make that available.\nCan you think of anyplace to get a large, shareable ham sample apart from a\npublic mailing list?  Everyone's eager to share their spam, but spam is so\nmuch alike in so many ways that's the easy half of the data collection\nproblem.\n\n"}
