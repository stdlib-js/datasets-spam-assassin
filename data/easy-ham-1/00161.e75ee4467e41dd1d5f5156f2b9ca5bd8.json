It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And\nthat the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo\".\nOthers indicated that various words might have different meanings in various\nNamibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in\nSiyeyi means testicles.\nAnother word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo\ntranslates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have\nintercourse.\nThe Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.\nStory filed: 12:37 Tuesday 8th October 2002\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
