It's a beta feature. Here's the feed for Microsoft[2] and one for \nMarimba[3]. Thanks to Jon Udell[4] for the pointer. Nice. Jon also notes that \nMicrosoft doesn't show up too strong in the weblog world and describes[5] a \nconversation with John Montgomery about this. What a small world. John and I \ngot to know each other when we did the work on SOAP in the late 90s, and weblog \nsoftware is one of the major reasons we were interested in SOAP. So close, but \nso far. But it's never too late!\n\n[1] http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000187.html\n[2] http://rss.finance.yahoo.com/rss/get?ticker=MSFT\n[3] http://rss.finance.yahoo.com/rss/get?ticker=MRBA\n[4] http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2002/09/23.html#a422\n[5] http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2002/09/23.html#a421\n\n\n"}
