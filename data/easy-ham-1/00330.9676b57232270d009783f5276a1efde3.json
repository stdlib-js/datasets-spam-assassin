We've got the corner on electric\ncars, fuel cells, two types of Nobel winning physics,\noutside the box computer science, and lot of creative writers.\n\nUCI's creative writing department has been in the \nnews a lot over the course of the last decade.  Some\nquotes from the article[1]:\n\n   \"In 1992, Newsweek called UCI's fiction writing workshop\n    'the hottest writing program in the country.' Now it's\n    exponentially hotter, thanks only in part to Sebold's daring\n    and uncannily timely novel. \n\nThe novel they are talking about is Alice Sebold's \"The\nLovely Bones\" which is on the way to the top of the \nNY Times best-sellers list.  My uncle used to tease me\nabout UCI (being a USC graduate from '54) that nobody\nknew who UC Irvine was just two states over.  In fact,\nI used to refer to UCI as one of the lesser known UC\nschools, and when I went off to college in 1985, my\nrelatives told everyone I was off to Cal State Irvine. \nI took a class as an undergrad by one of the department's \nfaculty called \"the art of writing fiction\".   If there\nwas ever any two classes that helped contributed to writing\nmy dissertation, it was that one which taught me how to\nget the writing flowing and my high school typing class\nwhich taught me how to type really fast.  \n\nOne of the advantages they cite in the article is that they\nseem to take a chance on the \"not-so-sure\" bet, but according\nto the article, the number of UCI graduates that have gone on\nto write best sellers and the handful that feed the film industry\nis creating a viscious cycle that lures more talent which\ncreates the right writing ecosystem, which churns out more\nsuccess stories which lures more talent.  \n\nGreg\n\n\n[1] http://www.ocregister.com/sitearchives/2002/8/25/news/uci00825cci1.shtml\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
