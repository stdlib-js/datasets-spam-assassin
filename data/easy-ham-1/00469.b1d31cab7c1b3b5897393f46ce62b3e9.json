Divorce didn't happen.\n\nYou seem not to know what a \"poor man's divorce\" is.\nIt is an old term, from the time when divorce was\ndifficult, but walking was easy, and identity was\nnot so locked down as it is today. Not every widow\nhad a dead husband.\n\n>I'm seeing lack of innovation ..\n\nThat doesn't tell us anything except what is\nhappening in Eugen Leitl's life. The more common\nobservation is that the rate of change is increasing.\nDo you have any data that might persuade us that what\nyou see is more telling than what others see?\n\n>gerontocracy favors gerontocracy.\n\nI would have thought that gerontocracy favors biotech\nresearch and plenty of young workers to pay taxes.\nNote that the fertility rate doesn't result from\ndecisions made by the old, but by the young. If we\nwant more kids, we have to convince people who are\nin their twenties to become parents.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}
