Now that machine, signed by both net-celebs, is up for \nsale on eBay. \n\n    This is the Toshiba Satellite T1960CS, 486 laptop computer seized by the \n    FBI on February 15, 1995, in Raleigh, NC, during the arrest of the world's \n    most celebrated computer hacker, Kevin Mitnick. The laptop is working and \n    has been loaded with a fresh version of Windows 95. A shrink-wrapped \n    version of Windows 95 on floppy, is included with the laptop. The laptop is \n    a 486DX with a color LCD, detachable trackball mouse, AT&T 14.4 PCMCIA \n    modem card, power adapter and documentation in FBI evidence bags. The \n    laptop has been signed on the bottom by Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple \n    Computer, and says, \"You've got the whole world in your hands. --Woz (Free \n    Kevin!). It is also signed by Mitnick himself. The system was shown on the \n    September 27, 2002 episode of The Screen Savers on TechTV, where the \n    signatures on the bottom were authenticated in a special show hosted by \n    Wozniak and Mitnick. A tape of the show will also be included.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Jimbo!_)\n\n[1] http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2057697313\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/NqDajD2X9Di\n\n\n"}
