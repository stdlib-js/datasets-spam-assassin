You're supposed to just shut up and take it.\"\n\nhttp://winerlog.inspiredsites.net/\n\n===========\n\nWho's the real monster?\n\n\nIt seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that\ndares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too\nstrong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're\nsome sort of monsters, violent ones no less.\n\nAnyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people\nare nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their\nway.\n\nYeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.\n\nThe truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and\nimproving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be\nsure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move\nforward.  How is that being monstrous?\n\nIs Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's\nperception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how\nthey feel about this foolishness.\n\n\n 9/18/02; 10:07:38 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\nDave deflects what he can't take the time to understand\n\n\nIt's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something\nthey usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek\nthe help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off\nand looking like fools.\n\nWhat Dave does is just the opposite.\n\nPosts a link to something he doesn't understand\nGet's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it\nDerides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.\nExpects others to do research for him\nAbuses anyone who tries to help him\nPontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue\nRealizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself\nPlods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy\nTries making the educated people look like fools.\nSends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.\nExposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.\nDeflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1\nHis continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be\ntrue.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you\nfollow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth\ntrying.\n\nOne reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  \"It's like that movie The\nPoseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the\npassengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about\nyou but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.\nThe ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot.\"\n\nDave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach\naround.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would\ngood ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hell\nwith asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he\nsavages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing\nall the trouble.\n\nWe've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking\namongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir.\nThat's where we're coming from.\n\nIf you have an example of how you've tried to help Dave, please drop us an\ne-mail about it.  We'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it\nalong to zaphod@egroups.com\n\n\n 9/12/02; 10:13:11 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nTrying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...\n\n\nThe trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.\n\nAnother developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it's fundamentally\nimpossible:\n\nHis basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web\ndevelopers are doing a terrible job.\n\nIn the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that\npeople at other tables start whispering \"that guy is an idiot...\"\n\nThe zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you've got a similar\ntale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.\n\n\n 9/11/02; 2:17:58 PM - Discuss (1 response)\n\n\n\n\nAha! Some backing down by the whining one?\n\n\nIt would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on\nhis crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.\n\nI'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.\nStill have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for\ntime-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have\nto prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A\nbusy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people\nwho make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any\ndeal-stoppers.\n\nHell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use\nit!\n\nThe poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be\ndragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So\nwith the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their\ncontent into totally unsupported garbage!!!\n\nYa better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start\ngetting rejected!\n\nOf course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter\nfucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his\n'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed\nwith his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be\nnice to him because he's still recovering?\n\nUh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking\nfights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your\nabusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.\n\n\n 9/11/02; 1:56:10 PM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nDave is Scary on 9/11\n\nPosted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002:\n\n\nNote: During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News.\nI'll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for\nPublishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of\nUserLand. I may be able to update my Radio weblog, but only if there's\nsomething really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe\n9-11.\nWhat kind of asshole wishes people a happy 9/11??!?!?!?!??!! Obviously\nsomeone who doesn't have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy.\n\n\n 9/11/02; 7:56:06 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nYeow and we though we were harsh!\n\n\nWow, apparently Dave's sticking his neck out quite far these days.  Craig\nSchamp practically keel-hauls him with this one.  He wraps it up with:\n\nThe man seems to show over and over that he's nothing more than a whining\nbuffoon\n\nGive that man an honorary Zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring!\n\nRelated links over at PhotoDude, Richard Bennett, Andrea Harris, Reid Stott,\nJeff Jarvis, Ipse Dixit, and the Fat Guy.\n\n\n 9/9/02; 12:29:45 PM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nRSS 2.0: code name \"Hitler\"\n\n\nIf Dave tries to steamroll RSS 2.0 through without formal community\nconsensus, here now we call it the \"Hitler\" release of 2.0.\n\n\"No objections\"?  No, he means \"No objections I choose to hear.\"\n\nDave is simply not listening.  People are objecting all over.\n\n\n\n\n 9/6/02; 9:00:02 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nReferral log funnies\n\n\nEvery now and then we check the referral logs to see what's pointing back to\nus.  We sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search.\n\n\n 9/5/02; 12:15:07 PM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nLuserland Attempts to Trademark \"RSS\"\n\n\nDave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any\nBigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally\nbankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.\n\nSo we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried\nto patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:\n\nhttp://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336\n\nThis was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development\nefforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS\n1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.\n\nCould Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!\n\nSince when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others\nto do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:\n\nTim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents. In the\nspirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.\nThere's no way to route around them.\n\n 9/4/02; 6:06:51 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nWhen's a Permalink not a Permalink?\n\n\nWhen Dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to\nnothing at that point. So apparently the \"perma-\" part in permalink is\npermanent. For everyone except Dave. Too bad his little attempt at a\ndefinition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n 9/2/02; 6:16:03 PM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
