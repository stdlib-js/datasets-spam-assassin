There'd be brainstorm meetings to come up with new topics to \ntackle (\"Howsabout 'Diligence'?\" \"No I think we did that one already, didn't \nwe?\") but mostly you could just hang around, bang away at whatever ideas you \nhad, show your manager what you were working on, and he/she'd give you \nfeedback, encouragement, tell you to keep at it, point to the poster of \nStick-to-it-iveness on their wall (Yes, we had our own brand of Successories \nposters hanging everywhere. I mean why not.) and give you the thumbs up.&#8221;\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.whygodwhy.com/archive/000071.html\n\n\n"}
