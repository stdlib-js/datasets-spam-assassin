You see it over and over again in\nhistory:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior\nAnthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became\nJunior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you\nknow it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive\nPeople are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is\nsubstantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the\nfacts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction\nthat is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American\nIndians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth\nin popular culture.\n\nI'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where\nyou are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you\nhave a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal\npopulation, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\n"}
