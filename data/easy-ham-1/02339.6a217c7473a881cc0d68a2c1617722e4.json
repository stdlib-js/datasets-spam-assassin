For example, action games played in closed-in locations need an \nengine allowing fast rendering of a few hundred polygons, a high frame rate, \nand a high level of details to impress players. Conversely, a game that is \ntaking place outdoors requires quite a different approach. This features \npresent one one technique for hidden surface removal usable in 3D engines using \ntilizing object occlusion.\n\n\n"}
