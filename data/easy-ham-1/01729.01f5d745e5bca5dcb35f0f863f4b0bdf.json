The most\npowerful discriminator in the whole database on one training set became:\n\n        'received:unknown' 881 0.99\n\nThat's got nothing to do with BruceG, right?\n\n        'received:bfsmedia.com'\n\nwas also a strong spam indicator across all training sets.  I'm jealous.\n\n> If people cook up more ideas I will be happy to test them.\n\nNeil, are using your own tokenizer now, or the tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize\ngenerator?  Whichever, someone who's not afraid of their headers should try\nadding mboxtest.MyTokenizer.tokenize_headers into the mix, once in lieu of\ntokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers(), and again in addition to it.  Jeremy\nreported on just the former.\n\n"}
