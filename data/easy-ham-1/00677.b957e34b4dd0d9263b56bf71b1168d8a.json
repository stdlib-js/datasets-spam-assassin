The document, entitled \"The National Security Strategy of the\n> United States,\" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of\n> the Administration's policy.\n>\n> INTRODUCTION\n>\n> THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and\n> totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of\n> freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom,\n> democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only\n> nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and\n> guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the\n> potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People\n> everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them;\n> worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own\n> property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom\n> are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of\n> protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of\n> freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.\n>\n> Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military\n> strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our\n> heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for\n> unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that\n> favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies\n> can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and\n> economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the\n> world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace\n> against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace\n> by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the\n> peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\n>\n> Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental\n> commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed\n> dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great\n> industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of\n> individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less\n> than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to\n> penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies\n> against us.\n>\n> To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --\n> from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and\n> cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global\n> reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help\n> nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will\n> hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the\n> allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and\n> countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop\n> new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every\n> turn.\n>\n> The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism\n> and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking\n> weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing\n> so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to\n> succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other\n> means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny,\n> contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous\n> technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America\n> will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We\n> cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must\n> be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence\n> and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who\n> saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have\n> entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.\n>\n> As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic\n> opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community\n> has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the\n> seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace\n> instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers\n> find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist\n> violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common\n> interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by\n> common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching\n> for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese\n> leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of\n> national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political\n> freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage\n> the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations,\n> because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and\n> international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great\n> powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,\n> trade, and cultural advancement.\n>\n> Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend\n> the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring\n> the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to\n> every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us\n> that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our\n> national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people\n> into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and\n> corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and\n> drug cartels within their borders.\n>\n> The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a\n> better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free\n> trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies\n> out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual\n> nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to\n> build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity.\n> The United States will deliver greater development assistance through\n> the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly,\n> invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also\n> continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of\n> AIDS and other infectious diseases.\n>\n> In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is\n> guided by the conviction that all nations have important\n> responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror.\n> Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the\n> spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international\n> aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For\n> freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.\n>\n> We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer,\n> better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply\n> the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed\n> to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade\n> Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as\n> other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment\n> these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations\n> are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to\n> rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.\n>\n> Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of\n> every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has\n> been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the\n> clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and\n> it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity\n> holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all\n> these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in\n> this great mission.\n>\n> I. Overview of America's International Strategy\n>\n>\n> \"Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We\n> fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors\n> liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists\n> and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among\n> the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and\n> open societies on every continent.\"\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> West Point, New York\n> June 1, 2002\n>\n>\n>\n> The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength\n> and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of\n> liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with\n> unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great\n> strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that\n> favors freedom.\n>\n> For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great\n> struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and\n> equality.\n>\n> That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and\n> race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and\n> discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we\n> are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by\n> catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must\n> defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.\n>\n> This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to\n> translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity,\n> and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a\n> distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our\n> values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help\n> make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to\n> progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations\n> with other states, and respect for human dignity.\n>\n> And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.\n>\n> To achieve these goals, the United States will:\n>\n> * champion aspirations for human dignity;\n>\n> * strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent\n> attacks against us and our friends;\n>\n> * work with others to defuse regional conflicts;\n>\n> * prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our\n> friends, with weapons of mass destruction;\n>\n> * ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and\n> free trade;\n>\n> * expand the circle of development by opening societies and building\n> the infrastructure of democracy;\n>\n> * develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of\n> global power; and\n>\n> * transform America's national security institutions to meet the\n> challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.\n>\n>\n> II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity\n>\n>\n> \"Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the\n> language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require\n> different methods, but not different moralities.\"\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> West Point, New York\n> June 1, 2002\n>\n>\n>\n> In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we\n> stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because\n> these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation\n> owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and\n> mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live\n> free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be\n> oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of\n> the secret police.\n>\n> America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human\n> dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state;\n> free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women;\n> religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.\n>\n> These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served\n> us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures,\n> facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these\n> core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not\n> been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and\n> aspirations of their people.\n>\n> Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in\n> our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of\n> Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a\n> stronger, but is a freer and more just society.\n>\n> Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And\n> when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central\n> and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When\n> we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in\n> the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin\n> America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can\n> evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all\n> cherish.\n>\n> Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today,\n> the national security strategy of the United States must start from\n> these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.\n>\n> Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international\n> cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation\n> of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international\n> bodies.\n>\n> We will:\n>\n> * speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of\n> human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to\n> advance freedom;\n>\n> * use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who\n> struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward\n> democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;\n>\n> * make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key\n> themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation\n> from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights\n> to move toward a better future; and\n>\n> * take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience\n> and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.\n>\n>\n> We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist\n> it.\n>\n> III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent\n> Attacks Against Us and Our Friends\n>\n>\n> \"Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have\n> the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already\n> clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been\n> waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is\n> peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on\n> the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of\n> our choosing.\"\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)\n> September 14, 2001\n>\n>\n>\n> The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of\n> global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or\n> religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated,\n> politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.\n>\n> In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a\n> lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed\n> within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United\n> States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals\n> with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who\n> knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.\n>\n> The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in\n> our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly\n> elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come\n> through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some\n> unseen.\n>\n> Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can,\n> and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to\n> achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition\n> forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not\n> only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of\n> trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South\n> America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.\n>\n> Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist\n> organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command,\n> control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will\n> have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.\n>\n> We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a\n> coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional\n> campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure\n> the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial\n> tools necessary to finish the task.\n>\n> The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the\n> financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of\n> funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who\n> support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial\n> system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists,\n> and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative\n> financial networks.\n>\n> However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the\n> cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we\n> seek.\n>\n> We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:\n>\n> * direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and\n> international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist\n> organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of\n> terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction\n> (WMD) or their precursors;\n>\n> * defending the United States, the American people, and our interests\n> at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it\n> reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to\n> enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate\n> to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by\n> acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing\n> harm against our people and our country; and\n>\n> * denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists\n> by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign\n> responsibilities.\n>\n>\n> We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international\n> terrorism. This includes:\n>\n> * using the full influence of the United States, and working closely\n> with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are\n> illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as\n> slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government\n> can condone or support and all must oppose;\n>\n> * supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim\n> world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote\n> terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;\n>\n> * diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by\n> enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources\n> on areas most at risk; and\n>\n> * using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of\n> information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of\n> those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.\n>\n>\n> While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also\n> strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter\n> attack.\n>\n> This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization\n> since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council\n> and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland\n> Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental\n> reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland\n> encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public\n> and the private sector.\n>\n> This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example,\n> emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with\n> terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened\n> to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and\n> mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop\n> terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.\n>\n> While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism\n> in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends.\n> Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations\n> and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where\n> governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we\n> will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and\n> our allies can provide.\n>\n> As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work\n> with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as\n> non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the\n> humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to\n> rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people,\n> threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists\n>\n> In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are\n> ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom\n> and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this\n> conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new,\n> productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in\n> ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\n>\n> IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts\n>\n>\n> \"We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion.\n> The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements\n> look so small.\"\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> Berlin, Germany\n> May 23, 2002\n>\n>\n>\n> Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional\n> disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In\n> an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our\n> alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create\n> horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states\n> falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to\n> alleviate suffering and restore stability.\n>\n> No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action --\n> direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic,\n> and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States\n> will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:\n>\n> * The United States should invest time and resources into building\n> international relationships and institutions that can help manage local\n> crises when they emerge.\n>\n> * The United States should be realistic about its ability to help\n> those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when\n> people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.\n>\n>\n> Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will\n> apply these principles:\n>\n> The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of\n> human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state\n> of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance\n> to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace\n> for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed\n> to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in\n> peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a\n> government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and\n> counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all\n> parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and\n> comprehensive settlement to the conflict.\n>\n> The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank\n> stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic\n> development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to\n> establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If\n> Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront\n> corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support\n> for the creation of a Palestinian state.\n>\n> Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine.\n> Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the\n> United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete\n> steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state.\n> As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw\n> fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent\n> with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement\n> activity in the occupied territories must stop.

The United States can play a crucial\n> role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and\n> Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.\n>\n> In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India\n> and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested\n> time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and\n> Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a\n> constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With\n> Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's\n> choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more\n> open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to\n> become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century\n> and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our\n> involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in\n> bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan\n> that can help defuse military confrontation.\n>\n> Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and\n> respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting\n> the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to\n> employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its\n> neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by\n> Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.\n>\n> In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with\n> countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil,\n> Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic\n> hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity,\n> opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as\n> the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States\n> (OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of\n> the entire hemisphere.\n>\n> Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising\n> from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict\n> and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and\n> security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active\n> strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce\n> their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of\n> drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs\n> in our own country.\n>\n> In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist\n> groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking\n> activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are\n> working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat\n> illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective\n> sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic\n> security to the Colombian people.\n>\n> In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war,\n> and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United\n> States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority --\n> combating global terror. American interests and American principles,\n> therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an\n> African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.\n> Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's\n> fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous\n> borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence\n> infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.\n>\n> An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars\n> spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions\n> of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to\n> confronting these emerging transnational threats.\n>\n> Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that\n> focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This\n> administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the\n> region:\n>\n> * countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South\n> Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement\n> and require focused attention;\n>\n> * coordination with European allies and international institutions is\n> essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace\n> operations; and\n>\n> * Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations\n> must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational\n> threats on a sustained basis.\n>\n>\n> Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the\n> surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are\n> conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically\n> waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to\n> the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a\n> common responsibility for democratic political systems offers\n> opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.\n>\n> V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends\n> with Weapons of Mass Destruction\n>\n>\n> \"The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and\n> technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear\n> weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs,\n> even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to\n> strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and\n> have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the\n> capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and\n> we will oppose them with all our power.\"\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> West Point, New York\n> June 1, 2002\n>\n>\n>\n> The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our\n> allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of\n> force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the\n> collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security\n> environment has undergone profound transformation.\n>\n> Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our\n> relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the\n> balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear\n> arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as\n> counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were\n> inconceivable.\n>\n> But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists.\n> None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power\n> that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and\n> motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain\n> destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest\n> states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass\n> destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex\n> and dangerous.\n>\n> In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue\n> states that, while different in important ways, share a number of\n> attributes. These states:\n>\n> * brutalize their own people and squander their national resources\n> for the personal gain of the rulers;\n>\n> * display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors,\n> and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;\n>\n> * are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with\n> other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively\n> to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;\n>\n> * sponsor terrorism around the globe; and\n>\n> * reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything\n> for which it stands.\n>\n>\n> At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's\n> designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against\n> Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear\n> weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become\n> the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested\n> increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal.\n> Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as\n> well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has\n> become a looming threat to all nations.\n>\n> We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients\n> before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction\n> against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must\n> take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new\n> partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military\n> forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective\n> missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence\n> collection and analysis.\n>\n> Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:\n>\n> * Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend\n> against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key\n> capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce\n> capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our\n> homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated\n> into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of\n> our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed\n> adversaries.\n>\n> * Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and\n> terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise\n> necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy,\n> arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction\n> assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when\n> necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will\n> continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their\n> increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and\n> threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20\n> billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step\n> forward.\n>\n> * Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD\n> use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of\n> WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such\n> weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading\n> enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States\n> must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our\n> forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.\n>\n>\n> It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of\n> this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the\n> United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have\n> in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy\n> of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be\n> caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option.\n> We cannot let our enemies strike first.\n>\n> * In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we\n> faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an\n> effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of\n> retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states\n> more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and\n> the wealth of their nations.\n>\n> * In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered\n> weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who\n> used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons\n> of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and\n> military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also\n> allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our\n> allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior\n> of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means\n> of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.\n>\n> * Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a\n> terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the\n> targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death\n> and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between\n> states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to\n> action.\n>\n>\n> For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer\n> an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves\n> against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars\n> and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption\n> on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible\n> mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\n>\n> We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and\n> objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not\n> seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would\n> fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use\n> of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed\n> and delivered covertly and without warning.\n>\n> The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian\n> population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law\n> of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001,\n> mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and\n> these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired\n> and used weapons of mass destruction.\n>\n> The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions\n> to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the\n> threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling\n> the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if\n> uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To\n> forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United\n> States will, if necessary, act preemptively.\n>\n> The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging\n> threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression.\n> Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek\n> the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot\n> remain idle while dangers gather.\n>\n> We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our\n> actions. To support preemptive options, we will:\n>\n> * build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide\n> timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;\n>\n> * coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the\n> most dangerous threats; and\n>\n> * continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to\n> conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.\n>\n>\n> The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat\n> to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our\n> actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.\n>\n> VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and\n> Free Trade.\n>\n>\n> \"When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a\n> privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever\n> enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in\n> better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade\n> revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.\"\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> Monterrey, Mexico\n> March 22, 2002\n>\n>\n>\n> A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing\n> prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth\n> supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher\n> incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs\n> economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it\n> reinforces the habits of liberty.\n>\n> We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's\n> shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic\n> policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our\n> economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of\n> policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic\n> growth, including:\n>\n> * pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business\n> investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;\n>\n> * tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that\n> improve incentives for work and investment;\n>\n> * rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are\n> confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic\n> endeavors;\n>\n> * strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most\n> efficient use;\n>\n> * sound fiscal policies to support business activity;\n>\n> * investments in health and education that improve the well-being and\n> skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and\n>\n> * free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the\n> diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and\n> opportunity.\n>\n>\n> The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not\n> command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the\n> best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further\n> strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for\n> all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the\n> developing world.\n>\n> A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S.\n> national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies\n> for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake\n> of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in\n> their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are\n> Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of\n> non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to\n> use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners --\n> including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they\n> are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher\n> global economic growth.\n>\n> Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic\n> growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand\n> the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging\n> markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise\n> living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a\n> world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that\n> allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in\n> their future.\n>\n> We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve\n> access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will\n> continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial\n> markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International\n> Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action\n> Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and\n> more effectively resolving them when they occur.\n>\n> The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from\n> occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing\n> so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy\n> conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on\n> achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy,\n> exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.\n>\n> The concept of \"free trade\" arose as a moral principle even before it\n> became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others\n> value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something\n> that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the\n> freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free\n> trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:\n>\n> * Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we\n> helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda,\n> especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for\n> completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the\n> accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade\n> Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.\n>\n> * Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies\n> in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of\n> the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United\n> States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners,\n> targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and\n> government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the\n> poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences\n> allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free\n> trade.\n>\n> * Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the\n> free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration\n> will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and\n> Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of\n> developed and developing countries in all regions of the world.\n> Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will\n> be our principal focal points.\n>\n> * Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every\n> administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with\n> Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished\n> majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing\n> Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for\n> developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will\n> work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade\n> agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade\n> Promotion Authority.\n>\n> * Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade\n> policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights,\n> competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open\n> societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional\n> integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in\n> developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa\n> Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods\n> produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more\n> use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue\n> to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer\n> countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access,\n> the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public\n> health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are\n> flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical\n> medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and\n> malaria.\n>\n> * Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices.\n> Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on\n> enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing\n> disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a\n> global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations\n> that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws\n> against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international\n> community must be able to address genuine concerns about government\n> subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which\n> undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.\n>\n> * Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound\n> statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used\n> in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the\n> American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the\n> enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that\n> the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American\n> workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the\n> change and dynamism of open markets.\n>\n> * Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster\n> economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with\n> widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental\n> concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy \"network\"\n> between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the\n> International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade\n> talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.\n>\n> * Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security\n> and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our\n> allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and\n> types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere,\n> Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to\n> work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient\n> technologies.\n>\n>\n> Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize\n> greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing\n> them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the\n> global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse\n> gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such\n> emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10\n> years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be\n> to:\n>\n> * remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for\n> international cooperation;\n>\n> * obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of\n> the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to\n> companies that can show real cuts;\n>\n> * develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission\n> reductions;\n>\n> * promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as\n> well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions,\n> while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;\n>\n> * increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to\n> a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change\n> by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's\n> budget; and\n>\n> * assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas\n> emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and\n> resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and\n> better path.\n>\n>\n> VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building\n> the Infrastructure of Democracy\n>\n>\n> \"In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to\n> rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we\n> must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.\"\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> Washington, D.C. (Inter-American\n> Development Bank)\n> March 14, 2002\n>\n>\n>\n> A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human\n> race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including\n> all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and\n> opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of\n> U.S. international policy.\n>\n> Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic\n> growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served\n> to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and\n> perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars\n> spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction\n> achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.\n>\n> Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this\n> failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing\n> for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and\n> the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.\n>\n> This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential\n> of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is\n> impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have\n> implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels\n> of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should\n> set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's\n> poorest economies within a decade.\n>\n> The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to\n> achieve this goal:\n>\n> * Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of\n> national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core\n> development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our\n> present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone,\n> these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge\n> Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest\n> in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight\n> corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest\n> in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and\n> enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward\n> countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those\n> that have not to implement reforms.\n>\n> * Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development\n> banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a\n> comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other\n> multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of\n> the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S.\n> contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S.\n> contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the\n> World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African\n> Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing\n> poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially\n> in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral\n> development banks to focus on activities that increase economic\n> productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law,\n> and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant\n> must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in\n> developing countries.\n>\n> * Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development\n> assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's\n> poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that\n> more children are getting a better education, more people have access to\n> health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a\n> better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure\n> the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering\n> results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own\n> development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral\n> development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for\n> achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA\n> replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation\n> system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time,\n> donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the\n> achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S.\n> contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the\n> World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this\n> progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything\n> that these institutions do.\n>\n> * Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in\n> the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants\n> is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,\n> particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with\n> ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA\n> agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the\n> poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water,\n> sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress\n> by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development\n> banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private\n> sector to match government efforts by using grants to support\n> development projects that show results.\n>\n> * Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are\n> the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases,\n> most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and\n> foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows\n> as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national\n> security strategy.\n>\n> * Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor\n> countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics\n> like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be\n> threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the\n> developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest\n> governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective\n> local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new\n> global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan\n> and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for\n> treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than\n> twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the\n> global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.\n>\n> * Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of\n> democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources\n> are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States\n> will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20\n> percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher\n> training in Africa. The United States can also bring information\n> technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been\n> devastated by AIDS.\n>\n> * Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies,\n> including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields\n> in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water.\n> Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits\n> to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still\n> suffer from hunger and malnutrition.\n>\n>\n> VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers\n> of Global Power\n>\n>\n> \"We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th\n> century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead\n> of prepare for war.\"\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> West Point, New York\n> June 1, 2002\n>\n>\n>\n> America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as\n> broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance\n> of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires\n> clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent\n> consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.\n>\n> There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can\n> accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies\n> and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the\n> strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the\n> North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its\n> inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European\n> security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world\n> trade.\n>\n> The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself\n> recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the\n> first time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the\n> transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop\n> new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new\n> circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice,\n> highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to\n> respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.\n>\n> The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened,\n> creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to\n> mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:\n>\n> * expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and\n> able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;\n>\n> * ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate\n> combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;\n>\n> * develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become\n> effective multinational fighting forces;\n>\n> * take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of\n> scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that\n> they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;\n>\n> * streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to\n> meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of\n> training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations;\n> and\n>\n> * maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as\n> we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.\n>\n>\n> If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a\n> partnership as central to the security and interests of its member\n> states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common\n> perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to\n> take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the\n> same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater\n> foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to\n> close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We\n> cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of\n> transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.\n>\n> The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances.\n> Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an\n> attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the\n> dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation\n> Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented\n> levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist\n> attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our\n> alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received\n> invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.\n>\n> The war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia\n> not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and\n> ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and\n> friendships, we will:\n>\n>\n> * look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and\n> global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our\n> close defense and diplomatic cooperation;\n>\n> * work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while\n> preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of\n> the region over the longer-term;\n>\n> * build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we\n> continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as\n> we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;\n>\n> * maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our\n> allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic\n> environment; and\n>\n> * build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with\n> institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\n> forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage\n> change in this dynamic region.\n>\n>\n> We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power\n> competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of\n> internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all\n> three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly\n> global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.\n>\n> With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based\n> on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and\n> Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on\n> Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a\n> critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive,\n> long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United\n> States. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their\n> country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external --\n> needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that\n> Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that\n> Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.\n>\n> United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to\n> refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and\n> challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the\n> global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the\n> World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to\n> promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have\n> created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security\n> cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will\n> continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the\n> former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable\n> neighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration\n> into the Euro-Atlantic community.\n>\n> At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still\n> divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to\n> build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our\n> motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our\n> relations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market\n> democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons\n> of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very\n> weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those\n> opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even\n> decades.\n>\n> The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral\n> relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests\n> require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest\n> democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative\n> government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We\n> have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through\n> the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest\n> in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.\n>\n> Differences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear\n> and missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But\n> while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about\n> India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with\n> which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership\n> with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic\n> future.\n>\n> The United States relationship with China is an important part of our\n> strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific\n> region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous\n> China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future.\n> Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst\n> features of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the\n> next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state.\n> In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its\n> neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated\n> path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national\n> greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is\n> the only source of that greatness.\n>\n> The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing\n> China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including\n> the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean\n> peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan\n> and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and\n> similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats,\n> such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the\n> welfare of our citizens.\n>\n> Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become\n> more open with information, promote the development of civil society,\n> and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to\n> political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting\n> village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national\n> one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly\n> accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work\n> remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think,\n> assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.\n>\n> Our important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into\n> the World Trade Organization, which will create more export\n> opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers,\n> and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over\n> $100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and\n> the WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance\n> openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic\n> protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other\n> areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the\n> self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human\n> rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation\n> commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but\n> not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.\n>\n> The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for\n> relations between the United States and other main centers of global\n> power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies\n> in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we\n> must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships\n> become routine and unproductive.\n>\n> Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We\n> can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober\n> analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices\n> that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open\n> the path of progress.\n>\n> IX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the\n> Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century\n>\n>\n> \"Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch\n> its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity,\n> and enterprise of our people.\"\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> Washington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)\n> September 20, 2001\n>\n>\n>\n> The major institutions of American national security were designed in a\n> different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be\n> transformed.\n>\n> It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength.\n> We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's\n> highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively,\n> our military must:\n>\n> * assure our allies and friends;\n>\n> * dissuade future military competition;\n>\n> * deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and\n>\n> * decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.\n>\n>\n> The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their\n> forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most\n> strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must\n> confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to\n> deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on\n> how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might\n> occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational\n> challenges.\n>\n> The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound\n> symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our\n> willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others,\n> the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of\n> power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the\n> many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases\n> and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as\n> well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment\n> of U.S. forces.\n>\n> Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major\n> planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate\n> across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch\n> of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by\n> developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision\n> strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces.\n> This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the\n> ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure\n> U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S.\n> infrastructure and assets in outer space.\n>\n> Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new\n> approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S.\n> intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and\n> technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is\n> run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention.\n> Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight\n> the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a\n> wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of\n> coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.\n>\n> We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from\n> experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must\n> and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy --\n> whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United\n> States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces\n> sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces\n> will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a\n> military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the\n> United States.\n>\n> Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense\n> against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed\n> around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive,\n> fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping\n> with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of\n> targets.\n>\n> We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to\n> keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be\n> appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems\n> and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the\n> capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the\n> knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek\n> the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and\n> to maximize injury.\n>\n> We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide\n> integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since\n> the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted\n> inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of\n> information between intelligence and law enforcement.\n>\n> Initiatives in this area will include:\n>\n> * strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence\n> to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence\n> capabilities;\n>\n> * establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides\n> seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing\n> the nation and our allies;\n>\n> * continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to\n> sustain our intelligence advantage;\n>\n> * investing in future capabilities while working to protect them\n> through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence\n> capabilities; and\n>\n> * collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the\n> government with all-source analysis.\n>\n>\n> As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend\n> America's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other\n> nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding\n> sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State\n> Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with\n> other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must\n> be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations\n> and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in\n> international politics must also extend their reach to understand\n> complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public\n> health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.\n>\n> Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil\n> wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief\n> requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build\n> police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial\n> government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international\n> cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American\n> readiness to play our part.\n>\n> Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out\n> to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to\n> public information efforts that can help people around the world learn\n> about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of\n> civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization,\n> a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas\n> and this is an area where America must excel.\n>\n> We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet\n> our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired\n> by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the\n> International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend\n> to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with\n> other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and\n> cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral\n> agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will\n> implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose\n> provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S.\n> personnel and officials.\n>\n> We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the\n> right level and allocation of government spending on national security.\n> The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this\n> war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for\n> the American people.\n>\n> Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is\n> diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have\n> a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas,\n> and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish --\n> our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are\n> vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we\n> bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks.\n> As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that\n> until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This\n> is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite\n> of it.\n>\n> In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and\n> interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act\n> apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we\n> disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for\n> our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow\n> such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with\n> our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.\n>\n> Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the\n> skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of\n> our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious,\n> entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that\n> energy. That is where our national security begins.\n>\n\n\n"}
