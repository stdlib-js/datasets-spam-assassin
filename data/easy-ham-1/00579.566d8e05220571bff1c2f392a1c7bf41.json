These tools\n> were largely developed to support the Cold War effort, and many are\n> labeled geodetic since they are used to make precise measurements\n> of the size and shape of the earth and the spatial variations in the\n> pull of gravity.  The tools of satellite geodesy are needed for all\n> aspects of global warfare; precise satellite tracking and gravity\n> field development are needed for precision satellite surveillance\n> as well as for targeting ballistic missiles; the global positioning\n> system is used in all aspects of modern warfare; radar altimetery is\n> used or aiming submarine-launched ballistic missiles as well as for\n> inertial navigation when submerged.\n> \n> The global seismic networks were developed, primarily, to monitor\n> underground nuclear tests.  Marine magnetometers were developed,\n> primarily, for detection of submarines.  Multibeam sea floor mapping\n> systems were developed, primarily, for surveying critical and\n> operational areas of the northern oceans.\n\n... and the Navy was in no hurry\nto declassify any of these data,\nas any uneven coverage could have\nrevealed the parts of the oceans\nthey found most interesting.\n\n-Dave\n\n(What do our seismic networks say\nabout the middle east?  I hazily\nrecall a story about LA reporters\nasking their local geophysicists\nabout an early morning quake, to\nbe told that, as far as could be\nfigured, the \"epicenter\" was at a\nnegative depth, travelling near\nmach speed, and presumably headed\ntowards Edwards)\n\n\n"}
