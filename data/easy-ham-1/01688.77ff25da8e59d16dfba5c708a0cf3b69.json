According to the README.txt,\nGBayes.py hasn't been kept up to date.  Is there anything in there\nthat isn't covered by hammie.py?  About the only useful feature of\nGBayes.py that hammie.py doesn't (yet) copy is -u, which calculates\nspamness for an entire mailbox.  This feature can easily be copied\ninto hammie.py.  (GBayes.py also has a large collection of tokenizers;\nbut timtoken.py rules, so I'm not sure how interesting that is now.)\n\nTherefore I propose to nuke GBayes.py, after adding a -u feature.\n\nAnyone against?  (I imagine that Skip or Barry might have a stake in\nGBayes.py; Tim seems to have moved all code he's working to other\nmodules.)\n\n--Guido van Rossum (home page: http://www.python.org/~guido/)\n"}
