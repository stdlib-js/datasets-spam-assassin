They would also be subject to\n> U.S. estate and gift tax during the 10-year period.\n\nI suppose it could be much worse;\nthere could be some twee affinity\nprogram for US citizenship, and a\nbank of phone people who only get\npaid well if they manage to keep\none from cancelling membership...\n\n-Dave\n\n:::::::\n\n> Last month, Congress proposed a new exit tax on all citizens who give up\n> their U.S. status.
