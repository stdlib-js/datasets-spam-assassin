Women actually are allowed to do things productive,\nindependent and entirely free of their male counterparts.  They aren't\nforced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels.   Sometimes,\nand this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even\nfind -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and\nthey marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I\nknow, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things\ndo happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my\nfather, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a\nmotivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation\nnow.\n\nIf guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then\ntheir opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these\nsituations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship\nis a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he\ndoesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished\nand teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest\nmarriage.\n\nEgh.  I really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent.   I\nblame law school and my cat.\n\n-BB\n\nALB> - Adam L. \"Duncan\" Beberg\nALB>   http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/\nALB>   beberg@mithral.com\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n\n"}
