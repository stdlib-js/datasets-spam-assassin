It is the\ndarkness of  the soul that has lost its way.\" The war we fight is not\nagainst powers  and principalities - it is against chaos and despair.\nGreater than the  death of flesh is the death of hope, the death of\ndreams. Against this  peril we can never surrender. The future is all\naround us, waiting in  moments of transition, to be born in moments of\nrevelation. No one knows  the shape of that future, or where it will take\nus. We know only that it  is always born in pain.\n--JWS\n\n\n\n\n"}
