That's actually an interesting \nproject with some potential for success, but at this point I'm sick of the \nwhole thing, so I'll leave that project for someone else.&#8221; \n- _Aaron Swartz_: TRAMP: Makes RDF look like Python data structures[2]. \n&#8220;RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal \nwith data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same time? \nNeed a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? TRAMP may or \nmay not be the answer to these problems!&#8221; Complete with an example of \nparsing FOAF files. \n- _Dan Connolly_: HyperRDF: Using XHTML Authoring Tools with XSLT to produce \nRDF schemas[3]. &#8220;XML syntax is a little tedious, but lots of people are \nevidently willing and able of editing it by hand. RDF adds another layer of \ntedium, but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand. I make \nheavy use of reification/quoting in my representation of logical formulas in \nRDF. This adds another layer of tedium that I find unmanageable, and I have \nbeen writing XML/SGML/HTML by hand for 10 years.&#8221; Also includes a cogent \nexplanation of the obscure profile attribute in HTML. \n\n\n\n\n\n[1] http://philringnalda.com/archives/002330.php\n[2] http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/tramp\n[3] http://www.w3.org/2000/07/hs78/\n\n\n"}
