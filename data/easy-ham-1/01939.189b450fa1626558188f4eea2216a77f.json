Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.\n\nBuffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like \nGTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply \nwarning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is \na belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of \nprimetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should \nair during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to \nrestrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The \nshows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and \nsome aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents \nand children wish to watch TV together during this hour.\n\nIt should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television \nviewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then \ndon't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or \nshoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because \nyou don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let \nyour kids watch it.\n\nThe PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example \nof one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show \ninappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems \nappropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their \nultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn't really mind, but the idea that \nall other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.\n\n[1] http://www.parentstv.org/\n\n\n"}
