It is the\nstandard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the\nworld-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending\nimages, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text\nfiles when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part\nof the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a\nrecipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. \n\nHow can I read a MIME message?\n\nSince MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use\nwhich do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing\nnumber of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular\nMIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the\nUniversity of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host\nftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)\n\nIn addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation\ncapability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do\nnot have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is\nstill hope! \n\nThere are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME\nmessage.  One of the more versatile is called \"munpack\".  It was developed\nat Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the\nhost ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions\navailable for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with\nolder forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also\ndecode messages in split-uuencoded format. \n\nDoes MIME replace UUENCODE?\n\nYes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so\nthat they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical\nlimitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust\nencoding called \"Base64\" which has been carefully designed to survive the\nmessage transformations made by certain email gateways. \n\nHow can I learn more about MIME?\n\nThe MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via\nanonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: \n                                                       \n     o  US East Coast                            \n        Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)        \n                                                        \n     o  US West Coast                            \n        Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)      \n                                                        \n     o  Pacific Rim                              \n        Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)  \n                                                        \n     o  Europe                                   \n        Address:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) \n\nLook for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt\n\nAnother source of information is the Internet news group \"comp.mail.mime\",\nwhich includes a periodic posting of a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
