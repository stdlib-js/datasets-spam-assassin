Some of this has to\ndo with the strange way the Canadian government is structured.  When I\nwas last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting\nsomething like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over\nseveral distinct issues.\n\nThe problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse\nthat is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their\ninterests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in\nOttawa.  While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to\nOttawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token\nrepresentation in the federal government.  While I'm not clear on\nexactly how the government works up there, representation is not\nentirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern\nprovinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have\nsubstantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire\nprovince of Alberta.  \n\nThe long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta\nas a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so\nmuch as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the\nsparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having\nfewer people.  Or something like that.  The Canadian government is less\nrestricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like\nhaving restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,\nAlberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities.  It is\nessentially a much worse version of what is happening in the\ninter-mountain West of the US.  Unlike the US case though, the rest of\nCanada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax\ndollars from Alberta.  OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.\n\nI have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally\nclear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial\nunfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little\nfuzzy on some of the details.  What I do know is that on average the\nAlbertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and\nthe sentiment has been getting worse over the years.\n\nCheers,\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\n"}
