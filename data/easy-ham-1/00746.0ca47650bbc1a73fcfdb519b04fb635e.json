But -- and this is\na huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  There\nis an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the\nright time, to go that high.\n\nBeyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is\ninvolved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model, for example.\nThough I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models.\nCindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.\n\nMost people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms.  It is the\nrest of us who tend to sort.\n\nThere is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the\nfirst place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist.  Sowell seems to agree\nat least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits\nof pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.\n\nAnd if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purity\nof heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally most\npeople seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better\nif it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the\nForbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door'\nis more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition.\n\nDifferences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far\nmore animosity than differences due to luck.  Luck can be forgiven.\nSuperior performance, often not.\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nGeege\n> Schuman\n> Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 4:44 PM\n> To: R.
