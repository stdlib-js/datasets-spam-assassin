All records with\n    spamprob == UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB have been purged.\n\nIt's in a zip file, and is only half a meg.\n\nJeremy, it would be interesting if you tried that on your data.  The false\nnegative rates across my other 4 test sets when run against this are:\n\n      0.364%\n      0.400%\n      0.400%\n      0.909%\n\n"}
