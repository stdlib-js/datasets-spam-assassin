No president since James Madison, nearly \n200 years ago, has seen the nation�s capital city successfully attacked. \nBut, one year ago, President George W. Bush was thrown into the first \ngreat crisis of the 21st century.\n\nThis is the president�s story of September 11th and the week America \nwent to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air \nForce One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, \nthe president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he \nremembers Sept. 11.\n\n�I knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for \nsome around the world to forget the mission, but not me,� Mr. Bush says \nduring the Air Force One interview. �Not me. I made the pledge to myself \nand to people that I�m not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So \nlong as I�m president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to \njustice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.�\n\nThe memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley \njoined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II \nwanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first \nhours after the attack.\n\nNot since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane \nbeen so central to America in a crisis.\n\nFor President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine. \nBefore dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before \n6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad \nAtta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, \nhijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the \nairliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet \nengines echoed in Manhattan.\n\nAtta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One.\n\n�I thought it was an accident,� says Mr. Bush. �I thought it was a pilot \nerror. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a \nterrible mistake.�\n\nMr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a \nclass of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when, just \nafter nine, United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was \nthe sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was \na coordinated attack.\n\nBack in the Florida classroom, press secretary Ari Fleischer got the \nnews on his pager. The president�s chief-of-staff, Andy Card stepped in.\n\n�A second plane hit the second tower; America is under attack,� Card \ntold the president\n\nWhen he said those words, what did he see in the President�s face?\n\n�I saw him coming to recognition of what I had said,� Card recalls. �I \nthink he understood that he was going to have to take command as \ncommander-in-chief, not just as president.�\n\nWhat was going through Bush�s mind when he heard the news?\n\n�We�re at war and somebody has dared attack us and we�re going to do \nsomething about it,� Mr. Bush recalls. �I realized I was in a unique \nsetting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and I was \nlooking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I \ncan remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to \nget the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident \nthat we were, you know, that the world had changed.�\n\nMr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called \nthe vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the \nattack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first \nwords to the nation.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America,� he said \nin the speech. �Today, we�ve had a national tragedy.�\n\nIt was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didn�t know that two more \nhijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick \nCheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent \nran in.\n\n�He said to me, �Sir, we have to leave immediately� and grabbed, put a \nhand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the \ndoor of my office,� Cheney recalls. �I�m not sure how they do it, but \nthey sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.�\n\n�There wasn�t a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice \npresident,� says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford, who was in his \ncommand center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First \nFamily. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. �We knew there \nwere unidentified planes tracking in our direction,� he says.\n\nCheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the \nPresidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this \nwas it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice \ncalled Mr. Bush.\n\n�It was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get \nout of the West Wing,� says Rice. �They were hurrying me off the phone \nwith the president and I just said, he said, �I�m coming back� and we \nsaid �Mr. President that may not be wise.� I remember stopping briefly \nto call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, �I�m fine. You \nhave to tell everybody that I�m fine� but then settling into trying to \ndeal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I \nthink the thing that was on everybody�s mind was how many more planes \nare coming.�\n\nThe Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret \nService executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of \nsuccession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become \npresident if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President \nCheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says \nwhen he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the \nWhite House, no matter what.\n\n�It�s important to emphasize it's not personal, you don�t think of it in \npersonal terms, you�ve got a professional job to do,� says Cheney.\n\nCheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers \nhearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the \ncapital.\n\nSays Mineta: �Someone came in and said �Mr. Vice president there�s a \nplane 50 miles out,� then he came in and said �Its now 10 miles out, we \ndon�t know where it is exactly, but it�s coming in low and fast.��\n\nIt was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the Pentagon, \nthe first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812.\n\nAs the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bush�s limousine sped toward Air Force One \nin Florida. At that moment, United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane - \nwas taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House, the staff was in \nthe West Wing cafeteria, watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer \nMillerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate.\n\n�I no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled \n�Women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run,� and suddenly \nthe gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and \nthe whole White House just flooded out,� she recalls.\n\nIn Florida, as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One, he was overheard telling \na Secret Service agent �Be sure to get the First Lady and my daughters \nprotected.� At 9:57 a.m., Air Force One thundered down the runway, \nblasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications \nDirector Dan Bartlett was on board.\n\n�It was like a rocket,� he remembers. �For a good ten minutes, the plane \nwas going almost straight up.�\n\nAt the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, World Trade Center \nTower Two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche \nof steel, concrete and human lives.\n\n�Someone said to me, �Look at that� I remember that, �Look at that� and \nI looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and \nthe horror of that moment,� recalls Rice of the TV newscast.\n\nShe also felt something in her gut: �That we�ve lost a lot of Americans \nand that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of \ncourse I felt the anger.�\n\nDown in the bunker, Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked \nplanes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11.\n\nAs the planes track toward Washington, a discussion begins about whether \nto shoot them down. �I discussed it with the president,� Cheney \nrecalls. ��Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these \nairliners that have been hijacked?� He said yes.�\n\n�It was my advice. It was his decision,� says Cheney.\n\n�That�s a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot \ndown your own civilian aircraft,� says Bush. �But it was an easy \ndecision to make given the � given the fact that we had learned that a \ncommercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision, it \nwas, I didn�t hesitate, let me put it that way. I knew what had to be \ndone.�\n\nThe passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They \nfought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow. \nThe flight was 15 minutes from Washington.\n\n�Clearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of \ngovernment as they could: the Pentagon, perhaps the Capitol, perhaps the \nWhite House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us \npsychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too,� says \nRice.\n\nMeanwhile, Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43 \nminutes. At 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of \nits twin.\n\nThe image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure \nlocation somewhere in Washington. �I was horrified,� she says. �I \nthought, �Dear God, protect as many citizens as you can.� It was a \nnightmare.�\n\nBy 10:30 a.m., America�s largest city was devastated, its military \nheadquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf \nCoast.\n\n�I can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the \nconsequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining \nmoment in the history of the United States,� says President Bush. �I \ndidn�t need any legal briefs, I didn�t need any consultations, I knew we \nwere at war.�\n\nMr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the \nhorrifying pictures, but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to \nCheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting, \n�This is inexcusable; get me the vice president.�\n\n�I was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says \nthe president. \"Information was just flying from all directions.�\n\nChief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David \nhad been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bush�s ranch.\n\n�I remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit, or \nthat the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of \ndifferent information,� says Card.\n\nThey also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the \npresident there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code \nname for Air Force One, Mr. Bush told an aide, �Angel is next.� The \nthreat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman.\n\n�It was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get \nthe president home,� Tillman says. �We actually have to consider \neverything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to \nmake sure that no one knows what our position is.�\n\nTillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret \nService agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The \ncrew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from \nair traffic control � a suspect airliner was dead ahead.\n\n�Coming out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an \nairliner off our nose that they did not have contact with,� Tillman \nremembers.\n\nTillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal \ntraffic. They were on course for Washington, but by now no one thought \nthat was a good idea, except the president.\n\n�I wanted to come back to Washington, but the circumstances were such \nthat it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national \nsecurity team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back,� says \nBush.\n\nSo Air Force One set course for an underground command center in \nNebraska. Back in Washington, the president�s closest advisor, Karen \nHughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr. \nBush.\n\n�And the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, \nsounded very shaken said, �Ma�am, I�m sorry, we can�t reach Air Force \nOne.�� Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the \nattacks. When she came back, it was a place she didn�t recognize.\n\n�There were either military, or maybe Secret Service, dressed all in \nblack, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. And I never expected to \nsee something like that in, in our nation's capital,� says Hughes.\n\nWhen she walked into the White House, no one was inside. �I knew it was \na day that you didn't want to surprise anybody, and so I yelled, \n�Hello?� and two, again, kind of SWAT team members came running, running \nthrough the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to \nthe location where I met the vice president.�\n\nOn Air Force One, Col. Tillman had a problem. He needed to hide the most \nvisible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the White House itself. He \ndidn�t want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening \nto air traffic control. So he called air traffic control on the \ntelephone.\n\n�We actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were \nheading,� says Tillman. �We, we basically just talked to 'em and said, \n'OK, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly \nacross the United States.'�\n\nControllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another, warning \neach other to keep the route secret.\n\n�OK, where�s he going?� one tower radioed to another.\n\n�Just watch him,� a second tower responded. �Don�t question him where�s \nhe's going. Just work him and watch him, there�s no flight plan in and \nwe�re not going to put anything in. Ok, sir?�\n\nAir Force One ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed \nback: �Air Force One, got two F-16s at about your 10 o�clock position.�\n\n�The staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside \nhallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows,� \nsays Bartlett. �And the president gives them a signal of salute, and the \npilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation.�\n\nThe men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts, from the \nTexas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander \nwouldn�t tell them where they were going.\n\n�He just said, 'You�ll know when you see it,' and that was my first \nclue, I didn�t have any idea what we were going up until that point,� \nsays Brotherton. He knew when he saw it.\n\n�We, we were trying to keep an 80-mile bubble, bubble around Air Force \nOne, and we'd investigate anything that was within 80 miles,� says \nRoberts.\n\nBush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this \naircraft, or for his own safety: �I looked out the airplane and saw two \nF-16s on each wing. It was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to \nget us.�\n\nWe now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war, \na false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered, \nwith the president out of sight, was he still running the government? He \nhadn�t appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly \nworried about it. At one point he was overheard saying, �The American \npeople want to know where their dang president is.� The staff considered \nan address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force \nOne to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At \n11:45 a.m., they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.\n\n�The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, \nwe will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless,� Bush \nsaid to the nation from Barksdale.\n\nAt Barksdale, the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington \nwas still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska, to the command \ncenter where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications \ngear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush had \na job for press secretary Fleischer.\n\n�The president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that \nwas said. I think he wanted to make certain that a record existed,� says \nFleischer\n\nFleischer�s notes capture Mr. Bush�s language, plain and unguarded. To \nthe vice president he said: �We�re at war, Dick, we�re going to find out \nwho did this and kick their ass.� Another time, Mr. Bush said, �We�re \nnot going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.�\n\nThe President adds, �I can remember telling the Secretary of Defense, I \nsaid, �We�re going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary, you \nand Dick Myers,� who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs, �are \ngoing to go get them.��\n\nBy 3 p.m., Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in \nNebraska. Mr. Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that \ngave no hint of what they would find below.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground \nCommand Center. It was built to transmit a president�s order to go to \nnuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in, the battle staff was watching \nthe skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed. \nAfter a short briefing, Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference \ncenter which connected them to the White House, the Pentagon, the FBI \nand the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent.\n\nAccording to Rice, Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls \nthat Tenent answered: �Sir, I believe its al Qaeda. We�re doing the \nassessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al Qaeda.�\n\nThe evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an \nessential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.\n\nA flight attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence \nof mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the \nseat numbers of the hijackers. �That was the first piece of hard \nevidence. We could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in \nthose seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those \nindividuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and \ngoing through a process of elimination,� says Mueller.\n\nIn Nebraska, the White House staff was preparing for an address to the \nnation from the Air Force bunker, but by then the president had had \nenough. He decided to come back.\n\n�At one point, he said he didn�t want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him \nout of Washington,� Fleischer says. �That verbatim.�\n\nOn board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world: \n�I had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that \nyou're guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because I knew these terrorists \nlike al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The \nother thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition \nof countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.�\n\nAs Air Force One sped east, the last casualty of the attack on America \ncollapsed, one of the nation�s worst days wore into evening. At the \nWorld Trade Center, 2,801 were killed; at the Pentagon, 184; and in \nPennsylvania 40. Altogether, there were 3,025 dead.\n\n�Anybody who would attack America the way they did, anybody who would \ntake innocent life the way they did, anybody who's so devious, is evil,� \nBush said recently.\n\nMr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in \nWashington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the \nway to the White House.\n\nWas there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White \nHouse to return to? �I don�t remember thinking about whether or not the \nWhite House would have been obliterated,\" he recalls. \"I think I might \nhave thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to \ntake our best shot.�\n\nMr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks. \nHis next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff \nwere already working on the speech.\n\n�He decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was \nreassurance,� remembers Hughes. �We had to show resolve, we had to \nreassure people, we had to let them know that we would be OK.�\n\nJust off the Oval Office, Mr. Bush added the words that would become \nknown as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those \nwho harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr. \nBush didn�t think the American people wanted to hear it that night and \nhe was emphatic about that.\n\nHe prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first \nheard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty \nmillion Americans were watching.\n\n�Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under \nattack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,� he said \nfrom the Oval Office that night.\n\nThe Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American \nhistory since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House \nresidence for the night, Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White \nHouse daily log: �The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today. \nWe think it's Osama bin Laden.�\n\n(CBS)�When Sept. 12 dawned, President Bush was demanding a war plan. No \none in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the \npresident would do. In office for just eight months, he�d never been \ntested as commander-in-chief.\n\n�I never asked them what they thought,� President Bush said of the \nPentagon brass, �because I didn�t really � because I knew what I was \ngonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done, Scott. And that was to set \na strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it, hunt them down and \nbring them to justice.�\n\nIn the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next: �The \ndeliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against \nour country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war,� he \nsaid.\n\nTo the war cabinet, al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor \nCondoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to \nstrike bin Laden�s organization well before Sept. 11.\n\n�The president said, �You know I�m tired of swatting at flies, I need a \nstrategy to eliminate these guys,�� Rice recalls.\n\nIn one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the CIA and FBI didn�t \npick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without \na sense of urgency, the White House strategy the president had asked for \ncame too late.\n\nChief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for \nwas �literally headed to the president�s desk, I think, on the eleventh, \ntenth or eleventh, of September.�\n\nOn Sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options - \nwho to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who \nworried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate \ncruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in \nthe past.\n\n�Well, there�s a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon, anyway,� Mr. \nBush tells Pelley. �A lot of people like to chatter, you know, more than \nthey should. But no, I appreciate that very much. Secretary of Defense \n(Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what \nwe called �boots on the ground.� That if you�re gonna go to war, then \nyou�ve gotta go to war with all your assets.�\n\nThe president says he wanted to �fight and win a guerilla war with \nconventional means.�\n\nIt was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director \nGeorge Tenent. Tenent wanted to combine American technology and \nintelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the \nTaliban government.\n\nSecretary of State Colin Powell, noting that the CIA had already \ndeveloped a long relationship with the Afghan resistance, called it an \nunconventional solution to an unconventional problem.\n\n�As I like to describe it to my friends,� Powell says, �we had on the \nground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some \nCIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force, the \nbest in the world. How do you connect it all?�\n\nThe president gave them 48 hours to figure it out.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Bush went to the battlefield himself. Just the day \nbefore, he had called the Pentagon the �mightiest building in the \nworld.� Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American \nFlight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush \nleft, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering \nthe remains of the first casualties of war on his watch.\nThe next day, Sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the \npublic never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but \nthis one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House. \nThe Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker.\n\n�He wasn�t real receptive to that, to that recommendation,� remembers \nBrian Stafford, director of the Secret Service. �And he ordered a \nhamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening \nand that�s what he did.�\n\nThe next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the \npresident. On Friday, Sept. 14, Mr. Bush started the day with a cabinet \nmeeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause.\n\n�He sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it,� \nsays Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have \ntrouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service \nlater that morning.\n\n�And I just scribbled a little note to him,� Powell recalls, �and I \nsaid, �Mr. President, I�ve learned over the years when you are going to \ngive a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will \ncause you to start to tear up.� He looked at me and he smiled and then \nat the next break in the conversation he said, �The Secretary of State \ntold me not to break down at the memorial service,� and that broke the \ntension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassed.�\n\nFirst Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and \nshe says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. �I wanted \nthe Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because I think \nwe were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting.�\n\nIt also stirred the mourners� resolve, as Rice remember. �As we stood to \nsing the Battle Hymn of the Republic,� she says, �you could feel the \nentire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind \nof spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve.\n\n�We all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had \nbeen lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what \nhad happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually \ngoing to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.�\n\nNext came a visit to ground zero. The president was not prepared for \nwhat he encountered there.\n\n�You couldn�t brief me, you couldn�t brief anybody on ground zero until \nyou saw it,\" Mr. Bush says. �It was like � it was ghostly. Like you�re \nhaving a bad dream and you�re walking through the dream.�\n\nThe president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men \nand women at ground zero began to chant, �USA! USA!.�\n\n�There was a lot of bloodlust,� the president recalls. �People were, you \nknow, pointing their big old hands at me saying, �Don�t you ever forget \nthis, Mr. President. Don�t let us down.� The scene was very powerful. \nVery powerful.�\n\nWhen Mr. Bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting, �We can�t hear \nyou.�\n\nThe president responded, �I can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of \nthe world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down \nwill hear all of us soon.�\n\nMr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before; he�d posed with \nthe firemen who always stood by whenever the president�s helicopter \nlanded there. Now, five of the men who stood with the president in the \npicture were dead � lost at ground zero.\n\nWhen the president arrived Sept. 14, Manhattan was papered with the \nfaces of the lost. Families, unable to believe that so many had vanished \nin an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just \nmissing. It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother.\n\nAt a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several \nhundred of these families in a convention hall.\n\n�People said to me, �He�ll come out. Don�t worry, Mr. president, we�ll \nsee him soon. I know my loved one, he will - he�ll find a place to \nsurvive underneath the rubble and we�ll get him out.� I, on the other \nhand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and \ncry, but I remember the whole time thinking, �This is incredibly sad \nbecause the loved ones won�t come out.��\n\nOne little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his \nfirefighter uniform and as he signed it, Mr. Bush remembers, he told the \nboy, �Your daddy won�t believe that I was here, so you show him that \nautograph.�\n\nIt was an effort �to provide a little hope,� the president recalls. �I \nstill get emotional thinking about it because we�re dealing with people \nwho loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved their�wives who loved \ntheir husbands. It was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for \nall of us because we were a very emotional, and I was emotional at \ntimes. I felt, I felt the same now as I did then, which is sad. And I \nstill feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my \ntears, I see opportunity.�\n\nThe president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes; \nhe stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard. \nThe body of her son, George, was among the first to be found at ground \nzero.\n\n�I called the police department,� Howard remembers, � and they said he \nhadn�t called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said, \n�No, I don�t need to call back.� If he hadn�t called in, I knew where he \nwas.�\n\nGeorge Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 \nwhen the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day, \nand he was off duty on Sept. 11, but couldn�t stay away. The police \ndepartment gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.\n\n�He (the president) he leaned over to talk to me,� Howard recalls. �And \nhe extends his sympathy to me and that�s when I asked him I�d like to \npresent George�s shield to him in honor of all the men and women who \nwere killed over there.�\n\nBy the end of that day, Mr. Bush flew to Camp David visibly drained.\n\n�He was physically exhausted, he was mentally exhausted, he was \nemotionally exhausted, he was spiritually exhausted,� recalls Card..\n\nThe next day � Saturday, Sept. 15 - Mr. Bush met members of his war \ncabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting.\n\n�My message is for everybody who wears the uniform � get ready. The \nUnited States will do what it takes,� Mr. Bush told them.\n\nAs Powell remembers it, �He was encouraging us to think boldly. He was \nlistening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he \nwanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.�\n\nPresident Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. �On the \nother hand,� he says, �I wanted to clarify plans and I went around the \nroom and I asked everybody what they thought ought to happen.�\n\nWhen he left that meeting on Saturday night, he still had not told the \ncabinet what he was planning.\n\n�I wanted to just think it through,� Mr. Bush remembers. �Any time you \ncommit troops to harm�s way, a president must make sure that he fully \nunderstands all the consequences and ramifications. And I wanted to just \nspend some time on it alone. And did.�\n\nWhat were his reservations?\n\nMr. Bush says, �Could we win? I didn�t want to be putting our troops in \nthere unless I was certain we could win. And I was certain we could win.�\n\nNine days after the attacks on America, before a joint session of \nCongress the president committed the nation to the war on terror.\n\n�Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it \nhappened,� Mr. Bush told the Congress and the nation. �We�ll remember \nthe moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. Some \nwill remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry \nmemories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It \nis the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World \nTrade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, \nArlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that \nended and a task that does not end.�\n\nA year has passed since then, but the president says his job is still to \nremind Americans of what happened and of the war that is still being \nwaged, a war he reminds himself of every day in the Oval Office, \nliterally keeping score, one terrorist at a time.\n\nIn his desk, the president says, �I have a classified document that \nmight have some pictures on there, just to keep reminding me about who�s \nout there, where they might be�\n\nAnd as the terrorists are captures or killed? �I might make a little \ncheck there, yeah,� Mr. Bush admits.\n\nBut there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list � \nOsama bin Laden.\n\n(CBS)�A lot has happened in the year since Sept. 11. One year ago, the \npresident was new on the job, with little experience in foreign policy. \nHe had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements. Now, \non his orders, U.S. forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did \nnot expect, in a world completely changed. In the Oval Office last week, \nCBS News Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the president about Iraq, \nabout whether Americans are safe at home and about Osama bin Laden.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nScott Pelley: You must be frustrated, maybe angry. After a year, we \nstill don�t have Osama Bin Laden?\n\nPresident Bush: How do you know that? I don�t know whether Osama bin \nLaden is dead or alive. I don�t know that. He�s not leading a lot of \nparades. And he�s not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he \nwas. This is much bigger than one person anyway. This is � we�re slowly \nbut surely dismantling and disrupting the al Qaeda network that, that \nhates America. And we will stay on task until we complete the task. I \nalways knew this was a different kind of war, Scott. See, in the old \ndays, you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his \ntanks or his airplanes and his ships. This is an international manhunt. \nWe�re after these people one at the time. They�re killers. Period.\n\nPelley: But have you won the war before you find Osama bin Laden dead or \nalive?\n\nMr. Bush: If he were dead, there�s somebody else to replace him. And we \nwould find that person. But slowly but surely, we will dismantle the al \nQaeda network. And those who sponsor them and those who harbor them. And \nat the same time, hopefully lay the seeds for, the conditions necessary \nso that people don�t feel like they�ve got to conduct terror to achieve \nobjectives.\n\nPelley: Do you look back on the Afghan campaign with any doubts? \nCertainly, we�ve overthrown the Taliban government. Certainly, al Qaeda \nhas been scattered. But some of the Taliban leaders appear to have \ngotten away. And there have been many civilian casualties as well.\n\nMr. Bush: Uh huh. Well, you know, I am sad that civilians lost their \nlife. But I understand war. We did everything we can to � everything we \ncould to protect people. When civilians did die, it was because of a \nmistake. Certainly not because of intention. We liberated a country for \nwhich I�m extremely proud. No, � I don�t second guess things. It�s � \nthings never go perfect in a time of war.\n\nPelley: Are you committed to ending the rule of Saddam Hussein?\n\nMr. Bush: I�m committed to regime change.\n\nPelley: There are those who have been vocal in their advice against war \nin Iraq. Some of our allies in the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia, Turkey for \nexample. Even your father�s former national security advisor, Mr. \nScowcroft has written about it in the paper. What is it in your \nestimation that they don�t understand about the Iraq question that you \ndo appreciate?\n\nMr. Bush: The policy of the government is regime change, Scott, hasn�t \nchanged. I get all kinds of advice. I�m listening to the advice. I \nappreciate the consultations. And we�ll consult with a lot of people but \nour policy hasn�t changed.\n\nPelley: On Air Force One you described the terrorists as evil.\n\nMr. Bush: Yeah.\n\nPelley: I don�t think anyone would disagree with that, but at the same \ntime, many in the Arab world are angry at the United States for \npolitical reasons because of our policy in Israel or our troops in the \noil region of the Middle East. Is there any change in foreign policy \nthat you�re considering that might reduce Arab anger against the United \nStates.\n\nMr. Bush: Hmm. Well, I�m working for peace in the Middle East. I�m the \nfirst president that ever went to the United Nations and publicly \ndeclared the need to have a Palestinian state living side-by-side with \nIsrael in peace. I�ve made it clear that in order for there to be peace \nthe Palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror \nand believes in peaces and quits using the Palestinian people as pawns. \nI've also made it clear to the other Arab nations in the region that \nthey�ve got responsibilities. If you want peace they gotta work toward \nit. We�re more than willing to work for it, but they have to work for it \nas well. But all this business isn�t going to happen as long as a few \nare willing to blow up the hopes of many. So we all gotta work to fight \noff terror.\n\nPelley: Arafat has to go?\n\nMr. Bush: Either, he�s, he�s been a complete failure as far as I am \nconcerned. Utter disappointment.\n\nPelley: There has been some concern over the year about civil liberties.\n\nMr. Bush: Yeah�\n\nPelley: In fact, an appeals court recently was harsh about your \nadministration�s decision to close certain deportation hearings. They \nsaid, quote, �A government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to \nthe Constitution.� Where do you draw the line sir?\n\nMr. Bush: I draw the line at the Constitution. We will protect America. \nBut we will do so on, within the guidelines of the Constitution, \nconfines of the Constitution, spirit of the Constitution.\n\nPelley: Is there anything that the Justice Department has brought to you \nas an idea that you�ve thought, �No, that�s too far. I don�t wanna go�\"\n\nMr. Bush: Nah, not that that I remember. And I am pleased with the \nJustice Department. I think that Attorney General�s doing a fine job, by \nthe way...and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure \nthat they review decisions we make, I think that�s fine. I mean, that�s \ngood. It�s healthy. It�s part of America.\n\nPelley: Franklin Roosevelt said that America should stand in defense of \nfour freedoms. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want \nand freedom from fear. Do we have that today Mr. President? Freedom from \nfear?\n\nMr. Bush: I think more than we did, in retrospect. The fact that we are \non alert, the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us \nmore free from fear than on that fateful day of September the 11th. \nWe�ve got more work to do.\n\nPelley: And Americans should not live their lives in fear?\n\nMr. Bush: I don�t think so. No. I think Americans oughta know their \ngovernment�s doing everything possible to help. And obviously if we get \ninformation that relates directly a particular attack we�ll deal with \nit. And if we get noise that deals with a general attack, we�ll alert \npeople. There are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny \nand run down leads. And the American people need to go about their \nlives. It seems like they are.\n\n\n"}
