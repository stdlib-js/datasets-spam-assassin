Here is a \nlist of things I intend to re-read once the fog lifts: \n\n- _Phil Ringnalda_: Using FOAF relationships[1] and Just say no to Trackback in \nindex.html[2]. \n- _Les Orchard_: Per-post comment RSS feed[3]. \n- _Phil Wainewright_: The bare necessities of RSS[4] and What to do about RDF\n[5]. The beginning of an RSS 2.0 best practices document. \n- _Jonathon Delacour_: Trying to score a goal[6]. &#8220;As the best and the \nbrightest focus on the possibilities of FOAF, I turned my attention to \nyesterday's news: RSS.&#8221; No, RSS will always be today's news. Get it? \nToday's newzzz... Never mind. \n- Comments on Ben Hammersley's Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a \nFOAF file from an RSS feed. \n- _Nicholas Chase_: The Web's future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We're losing backward \ncompatibility, isn't that great? Well, he seems to think so. \n- mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such \nas RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. \n- _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to \naccomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing \nlist[11]. Also the comments on Shelley's article[12]. \n- _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. &#8220;The best thing about this idea is \nthat unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both \nusers.&#8221; \n- New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release \nfor a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. \n- Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. &#8220;The secret to \nmaking a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to \ngive it more stability. He then rolls it in flour, covers it with batter ... \nand plunks it into the oil.&#8221; \n\n\n\n\n\n[1]  http://philringnalda.com/archives/002324.php\n[2]  http://philringnalda.com/archives/002329.php\n[3]  http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000290.phtml\n[4]  http://howto.looselycoupled.com/blog/2002_09_15_dy.htm\n[5]  http://howto.looselycoupled.com/blog/2002_09_22_dy.htm#85480973\n[6]  http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000707.html\n[7]  http://rss.benhammersley.com/archives/001387.html\n[8]  http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-xhtml/?n-wa-9192\n[9]  http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/cc/\n[10] http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/000541.php\n[11] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/\n[12] http://burningbird.net/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=541\n[13] http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1032794857&count=1\n[14] http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0209/23.usable.php\n[15] http://www.usablenet.com/\n[16] http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20020923/UFATTN/Headlines/headdex/headdexInternational_temp/13/13/22/\n\n\n"}
