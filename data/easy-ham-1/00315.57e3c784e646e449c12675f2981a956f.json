For example, audio recordings have such an\nexemption (dating from the early '80s IIRC), which is why you can't\n(legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can\ncontrol what you do with it after they've sold it to you.

If they can't figure out how to make\nmoney doing something, they'll actually burn money to make sure no\n\"industry outsider\" can either for all intents and purposes; control is\nmore important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a\nprofit.  They don't need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable\nbusiness behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few\npeople swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically\n\"investigated\" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar\nactivities, but that is mostly just for show.\n\nWhich isn't to say that the entertainment industry won't fall victim to\nits own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious\nprice manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
