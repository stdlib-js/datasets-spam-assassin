In \nlate 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to \nco-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens \nof millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet \ntransaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his \ncompany for a king's ransom.\n\nNot bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.\n\nA programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to \nChicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a \nmission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure \npasswords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded \nPayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the \ncompany.\n\n\"This company was founded on the notion of security value,\" Levchin \nsays. \"Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.\"\n\nThiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains \nfocused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good \nfortune.\n\n\"I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction \nprocessor,\" Levchin says. \"We spend a lot of time designing security so \nit doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. \nThe trade-off is fundamental.\"\n\nMountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with \ne-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, \naccepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The \nservice extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and \nmore than 3 million business accounts.\n\nMost of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led \nPayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. \nAlthough they were once rivals, the relationship between the two \ncompanies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition \nof PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.\n\nLevchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. \"There are \nareas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.\"\n\nAlthough security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's \nability to carry out open communications among the millions of \nparticipants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.\n\n\"This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to \none another,\" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's \nNext-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20\n\nPayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And \nLevchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on \nexploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst \ncovering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.\n\n\"If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was \nsusceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,\" \nLitan says.\n\nTo combat criminals, Levchin established \"Igor,\" an antifraud program \nthat monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin \nsays building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. \"The \nwork I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the \nwork makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has \narrived.\"\n\n\n"}
