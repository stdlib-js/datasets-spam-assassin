It's kind of astounding that there is \nenough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* \nFAQ) and \"eyewitness\" reporting without a single written source. What \nthe essay below doesn't seem to answer, though, is what the earliest \nattributed quote in print by any other writer is. I'd naturally be much \nmore skeptical if the \"quote\" emerged after his death... RK\n\n===============================================================\nhttp://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresBillionHere.htm\n\n\"A billion here, a billion there . . .\"\n\nDid Dirksen ever say, \" A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon \nyou're talking real money\"? (or anything very close to that?)\n\nPerhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio \nrecords of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found \nno evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to \nhim.\n\nArchivists undertook the search after studying research statistics \nshowing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote \nor its variations.\n\nHere is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed \n\"Ev and Charlie\" and \"Ev and Jerry\" shows, all newspapers clippings in \nthe Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen's own speech notes, \ntranscripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of \nRepublican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen's statements on the \nSenate floor as documented in the Congressional Record.\n\nAlthough Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to \nrely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular \nturn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or \nexcessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word \"pothole\" to \nremind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to \nthe debt ceiling:\n\n\n\"As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make \nthe deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were \nworking on a street. They had dug quite a number of holes. When they got \nthrough, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to \nthe hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic \nhazard.\n\n\"Not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a \nconference. After a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and \nsaid, �I have it. I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth \nand remove the hazard. We will just dig the hole deeper.'\" \n[Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].\n\n\nOn the same occasion, Dirksen relied on yet another \"spending\" story, \none he labeled \"cat in the well\":\n\n\n\"One time in the House of Representatives [a colleague] told me a story \nabout a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. He said, �Johnny, a cat \nfell in a well 100 feet deep. Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and \nthen fell back 2 feet. How long would it take the cat to get out of the \nwell?'\n\n\"Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a \nwhile, and then when the teacher came down and said, �How are you \ngetting along?' Johnny said, �Teacher, if you give me another slate and \na couple of slate pencils, I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes \nI can land that cat in hell.'\n\n\"If some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, I do \nnot find much to cheer about concerning it.\" [Congressional Record, June \n16, 1965, p. 13884].\n\n\nBut there are no such reminders for the \"A billion here, a billion \nthere . . . \" tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen's \nnote-making tendencies. He spoke often and passionately about the debt \nceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. Yet there is no \nauthoritative reference to the \"billion\" phrase.\n\nThe chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from \npeople who claim to have heard him. The Library of Congress, for \nexample, cites someone's personal observation on the campaign trail as \nevidence. The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard \nDirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. But \ncross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up \nnothing in the way of confirmation.\n\nThe closest documented statement came at a joint Senate-House Republican \nleadership press conference on March 8, 1962, when Dirksen said, \"The \nfavorite sum of money is $1 billion � a billion a year for a fatter \nfederal payroll, a billion here, a billion there.\" [EMD Papers, \nRepublican Congressional Leadership File, f. 25] But the \"and pretty \nsoon you're talking real money\" is missing.\n\nIn another close call, the New York Times, January 23, 1961, quoted \nDirksen: \"Look at education � two-and-one-half billion � a billion for \nthis, a billion for that, a billion for something else. Three to five \nbillion for public works. You haven't got any budget balance left. \nYou'll be deeply in the red.\" [Cited in Byron Hulsey's \"Everett Dirksen \nand the Modern Presidents,\" Ph.D. dissertation (May 1998, University of \nTexas, p. 226]\n\nOf course, the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late \nSenator's comments. For example, The Center that bears his name does not \nhave his testimony before committees. Their collection of Congressional \nRecords ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of Dirksen's life and \ncareer � he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses \nclaim he said it throughout his career. Dirksen's campaign speeches \ntended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated \nnewspaper accounts. Dirksen also held center stage before the video age, \nmeaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped \ncapture.\n\nBottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have \nendorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he \never coined it.\n\n�\n\n�\n---\nMy permanent email address is khare@alumni.caltech.edu\n\n\n"}
