It occurs at the very end\nof an excellent article which I recommend to you.\n\nIn the story, an old man enters a church where the congregation has been\nlistening to an heroic sermon about \"the glory to be won in battle by young\npatriots armed with the love of God.\" He usurps the pulpit and prays the\nfollowing:\n\n\"O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with our\nshells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their\npatriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of\ntheir wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with\na hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows\nwith unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little\nchildren to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and\nhunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of\nwinter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of\nthe grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their\nhopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their\nsteps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood\nof their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the\nSource of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that\nare sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.\"\n\nTwain wrote the story, \"The War Prayer,\" in 1905 during the American\noccupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn't printed until 1923,\nthirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it \"unsuitable\"\nfor publication at the time it was written.\n\n#  distributed via <nettime>: no commercial use without permission\n#  <nettime> is a moderated mailing list for net criticism,\n#  collaborative text filtering and cultural politics of the nets\n#  more info: majordomo@bbs.thing.net and \"info nettime-l\" in the msg body\n#  archive: http://www.nettime.org contact: nettime@bbs.thing.net\n\n--- end forwarded text\n\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
