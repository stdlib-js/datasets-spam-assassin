For example, I could copy a Gibson Guitar /exactly/ so long as\n(a) I don't put Orville's name on the headstock and (b) I license the\npatented bracing methods.  If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar\non eBay with \"Gibson\" written in crayon on the headstock, and then\nclaim it is a true Les Paul limited edition, I expect people would get\nupset.\n\n    M> Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away\n    M> is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  \n\nTo play the Devil's Advocate here, it's not about giving /stuff/ away,\nit is about granting endless and cascading duplication/distribution\nrights.  Even if _I_ only make the copy I give to you, that doesn't\nstop you from making 10000 copies to sell.\n\n    M> Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  \n\nThis is the difficult question:  How will they draw the distinction?\nThe \"other stuff\" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff.\nThis is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it's no harder\nto dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually prevents\npeople from doing it?\n\nPersonally, I don't think the issue should have anything to do with\nsales or units.  The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit\nshould be able to \"own\" someone else's intellectual property.  Sarah\nMcLaughlin isn't suing you, it's her label's legal dept because it's\nthe label who stands to lose; Sarah's already fat beyond her wildest\ndreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried up\ntomorrow, it's not going to really traumatize her (unless she's been\nblazingly stupid with her money)\n\nBut the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow so\nthey can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke.\nIf you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems\nwith beautiful-people deadbeat leech \"friends\" draining their riches,\nthink again.\n\nThe problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we\nmake the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,\nall it takes is looking at the same situation in a different\nway.  Here's the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record.\n\nElvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.  His fans did\nthe work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, driving\nmilk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/\nlabour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley's pills.  All\nElvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or\ncollect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as\nsomething of their own.  But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universal\nstatements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into\ntheir own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.\n\nTherefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay\nbefore they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royalties\nfor listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for\na beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over\nagain for the /right/ to make some hack writer's song /their/\nfavourite song????  That's where the whole system has been seriously\nwarped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your\nthinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It's not.  It's\nthe people who make them; the songs are already theirs.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\n Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com\n\"Computers are useless.
