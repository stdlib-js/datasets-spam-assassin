The two men pioneered the construction of giant\nunderground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from\nthe sun by the billion.\nNeutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because\nthey are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.\nIn fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South\nDakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.\nKoshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino\ndetector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and\nalso discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of\nthe brightest objects in the universe.\nThe Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for\nbuilding the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and\nsharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.\nHis research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the\ndiscovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the\nhearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.\nWhen academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside\nWashington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba\nalso was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach\nDavis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.\nThis year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney\nBrenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,\n55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the\nKarolinska Institute.\nThe researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ\ngrowth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how\nviruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as\nAIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.\nThe winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday\nmorning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of\nAlfred Nobel later the same day.\nThe literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish\nAcademy said on Tuesday.\nThe winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -\nwill be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.\nThe award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are\nnot publicly revealed for 50 years.\nAlfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who\nendowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.\nIn his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to\nthose who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and\n``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field\nof physics.''\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and\neconomics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts\nin the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted\nin strict secrecy.\nThe prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in\n1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.\n---\nOn the Net:\nNobel site, http://www.nobel.se \n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
