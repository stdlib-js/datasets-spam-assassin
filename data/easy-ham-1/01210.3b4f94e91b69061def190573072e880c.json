The only little\n(unimportant) catch is to replace \"kernel-headers\" by \"glibc-kernheaders\",\na simple \"apt-get install glibc-kernheaders\" taking care of that.\n\nUpgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and\nreleases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded,\nsome others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different\ndependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through\napt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered\nas the newest, thus being kept on the system.\n\nAs Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas\nor from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc\n(and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll\nprobably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)\n\nMatthias\n\n-- \nMatthias Saou                                World Trade Center\n-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta\nSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain\nElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
