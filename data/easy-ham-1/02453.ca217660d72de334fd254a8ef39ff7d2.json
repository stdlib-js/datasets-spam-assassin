Particularly exciting moments stage managing \"The\nCrucible\" my senior year when Becky's dad came to see his little girl in\nhis play and our male lead fell off the stage. Ahem.

Not to demean my own accomplishments, but I\ndon't have a &&^*$%&^% film deal, which pays more per hour than I'll make\nin a lifetime of short fiction. OTOH, count my blessings -- I've had\nfourteen stories in print this year, already fifteen more coming next\nyear, strong critical reception and my first collection due out this\ncoming spring.\n\nAh. I feel much better now. Take that, Becky Miller!\n\n(But I'll bet she drives a nicer car than me.)\n\nJay, back to work on the megafelid cranial capacity story\n\n---\n\"Story Words\" - daily microfiction at: http://storyword.blogspot.com/\nComing soon at blogspot: \"Teeth Party -- the Mad Hater and the Dorkmouse\"\n---\nWatch for my upcoming fiction:\n\"Tall Spirits, Blocking the Night\" -- TALEBONES #25, Dec 2002\n\"Jack's House\" -- STRANGE HORIZONS, Dec 2002\n\"Of Stone Castles and Vainglorious Time\" -- REDSINE, Jan 2003\n\"One Is All Alone\" -- STRANGE HORIZONS, Jan 2003\n\"You Want Candy\" -- AS OF YET UNTITLED, Feb 2003\n\"Walking Backward Through the Countries of Life\" -- HOUR OF PAIN, Feb 2003\n---\nJay Lake | www.jlake.com | jlake@jlake.com | 503.806.3626\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nforteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
