No dumping tea in the \nharbour or anything like that.\nI think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on \ntelevision, and that the tactics can be\njustified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative \nviewpoints from that medium. On the other hand,\nit was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and \nthe protestors were not in anybody's face\n(at least in my understanding of the vernacular).\n\nAnd no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence \npoliticians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and\nwriting checks is beyond many of us.\n\nOwen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
