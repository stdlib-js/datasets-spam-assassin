It is\npart of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.  \n\nFor comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more\nserious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain\nWest.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable\nprotest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if\nheated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the\nlocal population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests\nI've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually\nfacing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are\nprotesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets\nresults.  Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses\nand restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known\nto be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very\neffective at forcing dialog.  I don't recall anyone characterizing their\nprotests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.\n\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n"}
