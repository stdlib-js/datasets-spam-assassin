Lupa\n did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.\n \n As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his\n mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.\n \n Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,\n was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.\n \n Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police\n yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers\n from video footage.\n \n Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as\n contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact\n that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.\n \n The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on\n the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade\n through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.\n But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.\n \n The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary\n undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last\n minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not\n grab their reins.\n \n The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'\n boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend\n Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.\n \n The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles\n of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of\n the Assumption of the Virgin.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
