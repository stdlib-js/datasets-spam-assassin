Just for the record - \nthe average salary for\na university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ \n21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder\nhalf of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call \ncenters that\nhave arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some \nentry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an\nhour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in \n1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference\nis that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other \nwords, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, \n union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument \nto this is that many college graduates\n leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is \nthat we are the thin edge\n(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of \nthird-world wages and work practices coming\n to North America.\n\nI worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they \ncould maintain that (and prosper) just says\n volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people \nthere, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote\nwith my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large \nemployer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway\neventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired \nemployees were brought in by the employer (rumours were\nthat they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of \nrum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed\n a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, \nguess what - used to be a VP at the company.\nThat's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - \nas I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long\nas the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in \nplace.\n\nAnd if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of \nsome free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,\nare going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received \ngenerous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about\nthe labor markets here.\n\n>\n>BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,\n>*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,\n>all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and\n>there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,\n>most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have\n>*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically\n>all of that \"new\" money would have come from economic efficiency and\n>not \"stolen\" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.\n>\n>That efficiency is called \"progress\", for those of you in The\n>People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better\n>stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept\n>apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd\n>know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase\n>in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about\n>extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who\n>doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some\n>politician as Santa Claus come election time...\n>  \n>\nMuch as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I \nhave difficulty finding any - except of course for\nlabor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well \nunless the supply is tight)\nIt was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the \nself-made billionaires on\nthe list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the \nconcept of \"more stuff, cheaper\"\nwhich it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly \ngalling example is\nhigh-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that \nit is an area where the pricing\napproaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the \ntelecom industry (maintain your\nmonopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through \nthe same regulators) meet.\nSadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole \nentertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing\nseems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer \nseems less important than using\nregulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to \nproduce profits for the favored few.\n\n>\n>In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not\n>theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and\n>redistributionist labor \"theory\" of value happy horseshit is just\n>that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.\n>\n>To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx\n>wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.\n>  \n>\nI usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like \nthey're the biggest believers in\nthe Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the \nrights of that \"proletariat\" you've\njust created with bogus \"law and order\" policies , concentrate capital \nin the hands of a few (ideally people\nwho can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, \nand lie - use\nthe word \"compassionate\" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain \namount of poverty reduction actually\nhelps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the \nRepublic party seems to be the more homeless under\n each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.\n\nAnd the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining \nstandards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,\ngreater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the \nwork force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right\n to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining \nstandards of living) is the reality.\n\nAgain to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - \nthe CIA world factbook - on the US economy:\n\n\"Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to \nthe top 20% of households\"\n\nOwen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
