low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them.\n\n-h\n\n>From: \"Rob Shavell\" <rob@mobiusvc.com>\n>To: \"'Mike Masnick'\" <mike@techdirt.com>\n>Cc: <fork@spamassassin.taint.org>\n>Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??\n>Date: Wed, 21 Aug 2002 01:10:50 -0700\n>\n>right Mike,\n>\n>i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart.  my opinion is\n>only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant\n>show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing).  i am\n>mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.\n>\n>my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways\n>once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see\n>amongst each other.  that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on\n>their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice.  just\n>that it is fundamental.  from news to crime to privacy to dating to family\n>life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion\n>of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of\n>their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of\n>photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes\n>things 'big time'.\n>\n>rgds,\n>rob\n>\n>\n>-----Original Message-----\n>From: Mike Masnick [mailto:mike@techdirt.com]\n>Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:58 PM\n>To: Rob Shavell\n>Cc: fork@spamassassin.taint.org\n>Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??\n>\n>\n>Not to keep harping on this, but...\n>\n>At 11:36 PM 8/20/02 -0700, Rob Shavell wrote:\n>\n>>content: who cares about content?
