(remembering to never ever ever power\nup your system without a heatsink & fan).\n\nIf after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes,\nfrom it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and\nno actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you\nhave power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.\n\nOnce you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually\ndisjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.\nPower On Self Test.\n\nBod\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
