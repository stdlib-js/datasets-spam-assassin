Then the penny\ndropped. It didn't occur to the Germans that this might happen. It\ncaused great amusement.\"\n\nThe firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about �200.\n\nA Virgin spokeswoman said: \"Those determined to join the Mile High\nClub will do so despite the lack of comforts.\n\n\"We don't mind couples having a good time but this is not something\nthat we would encourage because of air regulations.\"\n\nThe new Airbus is the world's longest airliner, with teasing slogan\n\"Mine is bigger than yours\". Virgin is using it on flights to the Far\nEast and the US.\n\n\n"}
