A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they\nwould have had to invent it.  So it is with global warming.  Their\nfundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrial\ncivilization.\n\nThe fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming\ntheorists said should be there is old news.  The news here is that the\ntemperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have\nbeen validated with a different means of measurement.\n\nRather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global\nwarming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the\n\"Medieval Warm Period\".  Said period was warmer than what we have now,\nand it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2.\n\nIn point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused\nDIRECTLY by CO2.  CO2 doesn't trap that much heat.  Water vapor does,\nand if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have\nyour warming theory.\n\nYet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over\nlong periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback\nloops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.\n\nMore water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more\nclouds.  Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great\ndeal on how the cloud formation shakes out.  Most climate models admit\nthey do clouds very poorly.\n\nA good link is:\nhttp://www.techcentralstation.be/2051/wrapper.jsp?PID=2051-100&CID=2051-\n060302A\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nJim\n> Whitehead\n> Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 12:23 PM\n> To: Robert Harley; fork@spamassassin.taint.org\n> Subject: RE: Goodbye Global Warming\n> \n> > Gary Lawrence Murphy wrote:\n> > >and say hello to the cool:  Oooo ... /this/ is going to cause\n> > some stir ...\n> >\n> > Of course not.
