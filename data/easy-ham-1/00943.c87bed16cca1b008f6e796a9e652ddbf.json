People will go to \n> see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to \n> express their malice and discontent towards not only the present \n> regime in America, but also the corrupt, empty, shallow pantomime \n> which cast them into power.\n>\n> In reality, today the voting that takes place via the act of \n> consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth \n> and dimpling the appropriate chad, or some other such convoluted act \n> of free democratic expression.\n>\n> Why?  Because in America, they believe in dollars.  Dollars don't lie. \n>  In practise, they are the last frontier of truth in America, \n> universally accepted as expressions of fear, desire, passion, and \n> need.  Compared to the swing of the almighty buck, and Jeb Bush knows \n> this, a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning.\n>\n> Given that fact, I modestly propose an entirely new, though wholly \n> logical, extension to the current democratic system in place in \n> America:\n>\n> I propose we augment, and effectively replace, the electoral system \n> with a political stock market.  We should accept that Politicians are \n> entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in America, and \n> embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects \n> their intent.  A politician should issue a constant number of shares \n> dependent upon his tenure in government.  Those shares should be \n> traded on an open exchange, say the G.R.E.E.D. (short, of course, for \n> the \"Global Realists' Electoral Exchange -- Democratic\").  Politicians \n> we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their \n> ability to maintain office grows.  As the truth about their embezzling \n> campaign funds for weekend trips to Maui with their interns is \n> revealed, of course, their fortunes will fall.\n>\n> This represents an opportunity for the market forces -- those same \n> forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal \n> protest -- to voice their opinion on the quality of America's \n> governance during the intervening four years between elections.  \n> Elections themselves will in effect become meaningless, as they are \n> now, since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each \n> and every congressman, senator, and presidential candidate.\n>\n> Just think of the coverage that could be given on MSNBC!  \"Strom \n> Thurman (STROM: news - quotes) was down 15% today on fears that his \n> latest heart operation will render him unable to attend Senate Armed \n> Services committee meetings until November..\"  This would provide \n> rejuvenating content to the econo-political news sector, which has \n> found post-economic-bubble coverage to be both tiresome and \n> deoressing.  The establishment of this new stock exchange would of \n> course create jobs for newly unemployed (and governmentally retrained) \n> IT systems engineers who could, after passing the electoral securities \n> exam, become floor traders.\n>\n> This would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which \n> candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their \n> multi-billion-dollar campaigns.  The requirement for the support of \n> legions of spin doctors, permanent campaign managers, and investor \n> relations personnel would also create jobs -- perhaps even a new \n> practice for Ernst & Young, Arthur Anderson, et al.  Insider trading \n> scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch \n> Martha Stewart as an unwitting beneficiary, thus spreading her \n> influence to politics.\n>\n> Dividends, if there are any on record, at the close of a politician's \n> career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings.  \n> Pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support \n> necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the Beltway set.  \n> Union funds, brokerages, and even pump-and-dump houses could benefit \n> from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the \n> Southeast, and the Bush Governmet would be allowed to place Social \n> Security bets where they really mattered.   investors who lose their \n> retirement, life savings, and support could rest assured that they \n> were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors.\n>\n> Although there's no way to protect any of these for Worldcom-like \n> crashes, ambitious, inspired, District Attorneys could file criminal \n> suits against Candidates and Campaign Managers who underperform \n> expectations, thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty \n> -- instead, they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves.\n>\n> On the whole, I believe the system could work.  I could certainly work \n> as well as our beloved securities trading industry and, given the \n> American electoral system's success at effectively expressing the will \n> of the people, it certainly couldn't do any worse...\n>\n> In the meantime, Mike, I think I'll go see your movie and try to \n> depose the President.\n>\n> -Ian.\n>\n>\n>\n> On Wednesday, October 9, 2002, at 03:53 PM, Michael Moore's Mailing \n> List wrote:\n>\n>> October 9, 2002\n>>\n>> My Film, \"Bowling for Columbine,\" Opens This Friday\n>>\n>> Dear friends, fans, and fellow evildoers:\n>>\n>> I am very happy and excited to tell you that this Friday, October 11, \n>> my\n>> new\n>> film, \"Bowling for Columbine,\" will open in New York and Los Angeles.\n>>\n>> It is, I promise, the last thing the Bushies want projected on the \n>> movie\n>> screens across America this week.
