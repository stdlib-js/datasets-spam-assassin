This is because any granting of\n> rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long,\n> where, to whom, dates and times.\n\nThe GPL and similar licences are explicitly permanent grants of rights\nattached to an instance of his work.  (The other stuff mentioned\nconcerns contract law, e.g., the required element of privity, etc.)\n\n> In the absence of such limitations, the original author has the right\n> to change his software back to closed on a whim.\n\nNo, the author has the right to issue _additional_ instances under a\ndifferent licence, such as a proprietary (\"closed\" [sic]) licence.  \n\n> Rick Moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting\n> of rights which are not default. \n> \n> See the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to\n> be explicitly specified - under French law.\n\nThe analysis, here and elsewhere, concerns contract law.  This isn't\ncontract law.\n\nThis isn't the first time copyright attorneys have stumbled on this\nsubject.  I'm sure it won't be the last.\n\n-- \nCheers,              \"The front line of defense against such sophisticated \nRick Moen            viruses is a continually evolving computer operating \nrick@linuxmafia.com  system that attracts the efforts of eager software\n                     developers.\"  -- Bill Gates         \n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
