I've been in business for\n24 years and I haven't yet had the luxury of writing every line of\ncode for any project. We are always coerced by budgets and time to\nmaximize the amount of work done elsewhere.  \n\nAs much as I hate dealing with someone else's blackbox, as much as\nI've spent sleepless nights second-guessing external libs, I've never\never had the luxury to do otherwise. It must be wonderful to be\nresponsible for something you are actually responsible for, and I am\nso sick of being blamed for other people's design mistakes.\n\nMaybe there's an archive somewhere I need to know about, but I've been\nusing C since DrDobbs first published SmallC and yet I've never found\nany decent LGPL libs cataloged in such a way that I can just type in\nthe task and get back an API.  Because of Javadoc, which is by no\nmeans perfect, Java provides me the second best catalog of 3rd-party\nlibs, second only to Perl's CPAN -- Perl is one language I also really\nhate with a passion, yet end up using the most for exactly this reason.\n\nFor example, take the recent CBC Olympics site: I needed to roll\ntogether a telnet client with a tokenizer, perl-regex preprocessing a\nstream to produce parseable XML, project that XML into relational\ndatabases using only the DTD to generate the rdbms schema, and open an\nXMLRPC interface to read and post items into the news stream.  Where\ncan I find C libs for those components?  \n\nOn the webserver, we then needed a multithreaded read-only http socket\nwhich can spawn persistent data-caching servlets that periodically\nrefresh themselves over socket connections to the relational database,\npresenting the retreived values through XSLT-defined transforms, and\nagain, where can I find such stuff for C ... or for any other langauge\nbut Java?  Wombat (servlet spec for Perl) was inviting, but it's not\nready for prime-time, and re-inventing that entire shopping list in C\nis just not feasible for one programmer to do inside of 8 weeks.\n\nWhen you need C libs, or even C++ libs, where's the best place to shop?\nWhere do you find standards-based portable RDBMS API? (ODBC?) How do\nyou evaluate these things without actually fetching every one and\ntrying it out?\n\nIn a perfect universe, I'd use Ocaml or even Ruby, but I don't see the\nsocial infrastructure for either happening during my professional\nlifetime.\n\n    R> Why do so many people outside of Sun's marketing department\n    R> consider Java to be \"Write Once, Debug Everywhere\" ?\n\nA collegue at Cognos (Henk?) called C \"the nearly-portable assembler\"\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\n Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com\n\"Computers are useless.
