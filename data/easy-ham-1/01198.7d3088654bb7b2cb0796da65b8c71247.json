I \nwill be making a new release soon, but even in the meantime, 0.8.7 \npackages would be ok.\n\nI know that in the beta, red hat was using a modified version of \ngnome-libs which is incompatible with the latest gnomemm. If this is \nstill the case in 8, I can send you a patch which makes gnomemm work \nagain...\n\nJulian\n\nOn Monday, Sep 30, 2002, at 03:28 US/Eastern, Matthias Saou wrote:\n\n> Hi all,\n>\n> All freshrpms.net is now set for the imminent release of Red Hat Linux \n> 8.0.\n> The whole release process is a lot less secret as usual since there \n> have\n> been some leaks, including a mirror purposely wide open :-(\n>\n> See this article about the release and the leaks :\n> http://news.com.com/2100-1001-959434.html?tag=fd_top\n>\n> As it's no secret anymore, the files will be available today (morning \n> for\n> you Americans, afternoon for us Europeans), and to go with them, there \n> are\n> already quite a few freshrpms.net packages ready!\n>\n> Mirror list for download (they're not open yet) :\n> http://freshrpms.net/mirrors/psyche.html\n>\n> New freshrpms.net package list :\n> http://psyche.freshrpms.net/\n>\n> Of course, apt is also available (now version 0.5.4!) and fully \n> tested.
