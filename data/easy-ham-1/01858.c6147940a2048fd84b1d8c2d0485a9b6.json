Maybe I'm slow \nthis morning, or maybe I'm spoiled, but what's the big deal. I thought they \nalready had this. My personal aggregator[2] is better, it shows me what I'm \ninterested in, it's not one size fits all. Help me figure this out. I'm sure \nthere's something innovative here, I just don't see it.\n\n[1] http://news.google.com/\n[2] http://radio.userland.com/newsAggregator\n\n\n"}
