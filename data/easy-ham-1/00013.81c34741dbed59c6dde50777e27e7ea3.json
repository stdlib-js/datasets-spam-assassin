Which\nseems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was\ntrying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only\nas I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and\nqueried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on\nthe new rootfs.\n\n When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked\nfine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked.\n\n Woohoo.\n\nKate\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
