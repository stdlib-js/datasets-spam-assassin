Read list-managers for any\nlength of time and you'll find that there are a lot of people who\nassert strict copyright over their collections, are very protective of\ntheir traffic, and got really pissed when gmane just started\ngatewaying their messages without asking.\n\nWhich might be an appropriate for their lists, but not for ours (don't\nthink I'm suggesting we do the same -- I /like/ our laissez-faire\napproach).\n\nBut for personal email, we should be more careful.\n-Barry\n"}
