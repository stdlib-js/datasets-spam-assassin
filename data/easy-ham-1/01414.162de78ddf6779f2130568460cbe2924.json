Fat chance.\n\nMy problem is not the same as MS's one, I don't have to deal with millions of \nidentical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each \ndownload can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is \na problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers, \nyou'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we \nthink of something like a health care system that keep track of patients \npersonnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible \nsteps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.\n\nI agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy \nin a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market \npenetration.\n\nBTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I'm playing with \ngdb's dissassembler now but I don't think it's what a typical cracker would \nuse.  Any hints on UNIX cracking tools ?\n\nThanks.\n\n-- \nYannick Gingras\nCoder for OBB : Onside Brainsick Bract\nhttp://OpenBeatBox.org\n\n\n"}
