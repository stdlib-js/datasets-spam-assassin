I get destined for many addresses: skip@pobox.com,\nskip@calendar.com, concerts@musi-cal.com, webmaster@mojam.com, etc.  I\noriginally wrote (a slightly different version of) the loosecksum.py script\nI'm about to check in to avoid manually scanning all those presumed spams\nwhich are really identical.  Once a message was identified as spam, what I\nrefer to as a loose checksum was computed to try and avoid saving the same\nspam multiple times for later review.\n\n    >> Would people be interested in the script?

Let me know if you find it useful.\n\nSkip\n\n"}
