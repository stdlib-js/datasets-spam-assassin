I'm sure both sides were equally ready to be the aggressor\nprovided they were in a predominant position of power.\n\n> Bush's reluctance to blast blind obeyance of religion as taught by\nyour\n> local madrassa or KKK leader, apparently because he is fully involved\n> with the general effort to expand unfettered religiosity as the\nsolution\n> to the world's ills, is disappointing.

Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters.\n2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.\n3.
