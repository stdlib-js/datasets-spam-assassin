It has to work certainly, and in\nparticular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to\nwork on client's systems.\n\nMy limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on\nLinux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.\n\nMicrosoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.\nThey took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a\nservice pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to\nrun C programs.\n\n\n>2.

Depends\nentirely on the programmer, not the language.\n\n\n>3.  Java is not just a programming language!

E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC\nin a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be\n10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable\nlibraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.\nAt least that is the case when then language you used is available on\nthe target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.\n\n\n>5.

Hardware is getting so fast that I'm not sure if the performance\n>difference between Java and C/C++ are relevant any more.\n\nWhoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I'm taking\ntime out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could\nwait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's\nin no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code\nthat is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,\nor I can do it now when very few people can.\n\n \n>The end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved.\n\nYes.\n\n\n>And for those problems, languages such as Java, SmallTalk, and others\n>allow you to think more high level than low level.  Thinking of bits\n>and bytes takes too much gray matter away from the real important\n>problems....\n\nIt's true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes\nme spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!\nNot.\n\nActually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.\n\n\n>Why do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems\n>over and over again [...]\n\nDunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.\n\n\nI'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.
