They were all getting married within a \nshort time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex \nlife would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard \nfrom the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. \n\nThe first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The \ncard said nothing but \"Maxwell House\".  Mom was puzzled at first, but \nthen went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: \"Good till \nthe last drop.\" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. \n\nThe second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, \nand the card read: \"Benson & Hedges\".  Mom now knew to go straight to \nher husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: \n\"Extra Long, King Size\".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still \nhappy for her daughter. \n\nThe third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for \na week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a \nwhole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky \nhandwriting were the words: \"British Airways\".  Mom took out her latest \nHarper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, \nand finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: \"Three times a \nday, seven days a week, both ways.\" \n\nMom fainted. \n\n\n"}
