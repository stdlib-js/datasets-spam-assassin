The problem IIRC\nis with crappy hardware that is supposed to support DMA but doesn't work as\nexpected when it's enabled... maybe Chris could confirm this? ;-)\n\nI guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting\nthe DMA tip in the %description :-)\n\nMatthias\n\n-- \nClean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/\nRed Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10acpi\nLoad : 0.00 0.05 0.14\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
