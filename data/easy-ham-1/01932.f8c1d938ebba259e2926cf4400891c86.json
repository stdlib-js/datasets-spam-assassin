I have to \nadmit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, \"Do you \nreally agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!\"\n\nDo I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of \ncourse not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in \nmind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily \nagreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas \nregarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is \nan issue that needs to be addressed. That's something.\n\nTo cover the list specifically:\n\n\n- Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's \nproposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is \npainfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in \norder for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.\n\n- Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the \nuseless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain \nspeed.\n\n- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield \nwidget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, \nslow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's \ntop usability problem.\n\n- Message display - Yes. No argument here.\n\n- Search - Yeah, it's a mess. Don't know if it would be in my top ten, but it's \na mess.\n\n- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be \nseparated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with \nmultiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., \nyou can eliminate the New submenu easily).\n\n- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.\n\n- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS \ndefault on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. \nIf you don't like it, complain about Win32, but don't cite this as a Mozilla \nusability problem when we're following the conventions of the operating system. \n(We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 \nwants to fire it.)\n\n- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is \ncompletely irrelevant.\n\n- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a \ntangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique \ndialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly \nhalf the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously \noverconfigurable.\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.blakeross.com/archives/2002_08_18_index.html#80418641\n[2] http://mpt.phrasewise.com\n\n\n"}
