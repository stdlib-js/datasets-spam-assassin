Kelly's comment seems more like\ndrivel from a clueless marketroid than anything of technical concern.\n\nHaving what appears to be a silicon XML router would be a cool thing.  Having\none integrated with your crypto environment would kick ass.  Let it\ndeserialize/decrypt/repackage the XML before handing it off to the app servers.\nThe question, of course, is does it work with actual applications in the field\nwithout tremendously reworking them.  Somehow I doubt it...\n\n-Bill Kearney\n\n"}
