Bayes) or the interface has changed (spam_level_char=x). As the rules \nare under fluent development, the user has to update quite regularly. But \ncurrently he couldn't be shure if the new release will break anything in \nhis setup (like -F going away). So if we say \"the branches are stable to \nthe outside and just improved under the surface but you have to watch out \nwhen you update to a new minor version number\", users and sysadmins could \nbe less reluctant to update.\n\nAll just IMHO :o)\nMalte\n\nP.S.: I'll be away from my box and my mail account for one week, starting \ntomorrow. So happy coding for the next week :-)\n\n-- \n--- Coding is art.\n-- \n\n\n\n"}
