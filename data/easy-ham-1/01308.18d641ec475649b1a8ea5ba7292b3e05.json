Daev Walsh forwards an article from\nThe Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''.  This story is also immortalised\nin an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy\nwas a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I\nnow live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely\nlegal, way to make money.\n\nBlogEnd: \nLinkText: Billy in the Bowl\n\nFrom:         daev <hellshaw@fringeware.com>\nSubject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler\n\nA story of my new neighbourhood...\n\n\nThe Irish Digest July 1964\n\n\nThe Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler\n\nThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.\nThen, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life \n\nDUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the\narchitectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of\nbeggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these\nbeggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one\nwho campaigned among the working class.  This was \"Billy In The Bowl\"\n\nThe strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means\nof transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this \"\nbowl \", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground\nwith wooden plugs, one in each hand.\n\nBilly's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been\nborn without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing\nhim with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an\nunusually handsome face.\n\nThis was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating\nsympathetic passers-by from their small change.\n\nThe cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many\nlonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century\nGrangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would\ncome along.\n\nHe would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his\nblack curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a\nhandsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.\n\n\"Billy in the Bowl\", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily\nowner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were\nsubstantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could\nindulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.\n\nAs a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.\nThe first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening\nas dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing\nthrough Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on\nDublin's North Quays.\n\nWhen Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a\nditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the\nbeggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.\n\nTrembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay\nconcealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two\npowerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.\n\nIn a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy\nwas travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his \" bowl \", his victirn's\npurse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was\nfound in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her\nassailant.  And, as \"Billy in the Bowl\" had figured, nobody would suspect a\ndeformed beggar.\n\nAgain and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting\nthe place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.\n\nOn one occasion \" Billy in \"the Bowl \" tried his tactics on a sturdy\nservant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to\nstrangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder\nand caused a great stir.\n\nHundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months\n\"Billy in the Bowl\" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this\nperiod, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first\ncase they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.\n\nMonths passed and  \"Billy in the Bowl\" reverted once again to his old\npasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and\nrobbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a\nnightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled\nalong in his \"bowl\" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that\nfinished Billy's career of crime.\n\nTwo stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment\nafter a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to\nhear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the\nditch.\n\nBilly, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and\ntried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,\nhowever) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.\n\nMeanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her\nlarge hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.\n\nThe screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the\ndistrict and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member\nof the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.\n\n\"Billy in the Bowl\" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but\nthey could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The\nGrangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive\nDublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed\nand giggled as they wended their way home at night.\n\n\n\ndaev\n\n_______________________________\nRev.
