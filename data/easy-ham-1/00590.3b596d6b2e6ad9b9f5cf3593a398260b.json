Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters.\n>\nA)  Which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past? \n Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc.\nB) \"How it is currently being expressed\" amounts to a tacit \nacknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and \npeople's self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive \nexpression.  This leads to the point that religion and less \nsophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke \nthe image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of \nsociety.\nC) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but they also \naren't 'found in the wild'.\n\n(By \"primitive expression\", I don't mean to slight any society, but that \nthere is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized \nbehavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.). \n The US has only really been mostly free of \"primitive expression\" for \n40-50 years, although large categories, including serious religious \nconflict, were settled quite a while ago.)\n\nD) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or \nless concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated \nby splitting society too much along religious lines.  One Post article \npointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical \nintegration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, \ngovernment, political party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage \nof British conquest, but who doesn't?)\n\n(I couldn't find the article I remember, but here are a couple of others:)\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A33761-2001Jul8&notFound=true\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A15956-2002Jul16&notFound=true\n\n'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and \ncloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and \nreligiously divided. About 54 percent of the population is Protestant, \nand most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part \nof Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or \nnationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.\n\n\nIn 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the \nRev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in the American South. But \nviolence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling \nthe political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both \nsides. Police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by \nfar was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a goal of a united \nIreland\n\nThe provincial police force estimates that about 3,600 people were \nkilled during the 30-year conflict known, with characteristic Northern \nIreland understatement, as \"The Troubles.\"'\n\n>2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.\n>\nThat's fine, as it would be an inappropriate concentration.  It would be \ndifficult to address the issues raised here in a clean way.  I'd be \nhappy with an acknowledgement that the connection is there.\n\n>3. US Leadership remains reflexively multi-cultural.\n>\nThis is ok to a point, as long as it doesn't shy away from logical, \nobjective analysis of when a society could be seriously improved in \ncertain ways.\n\n>>We all have\n>>disagreements, but at some point it becomes a crime against humanity.\n>>    \n>>\n>\n>I didn't say burning the train was a good thing.
