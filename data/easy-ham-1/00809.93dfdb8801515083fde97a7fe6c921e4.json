As it was posted to \"discussion\" I\nthought there'd be some.\n\nInstead it's a Post-Gazette column by Brian O'Neill\nlamenting the fact that some people know how to\nfill out a permit so that they can take advantage\nof their right to peaceable assembly.  Obviously\nhe's poking fun at the idea that specific groups\nget specific \"zones\" and that it's not up to the\npolice to decide what messages and signs get put into\nwhat zones to most expediently keep order.  \n\nThe problem is that politics have gotten so muddied\nnowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting\npolitical rallies that you don't agree with has become\ncommon practice.  The courts have constantly ruled\nthat there are some restrictions on the first amendment.\nThey teach you that your very first year of law school.\n\nI think that given the information as laid out by the story,\nMr. O'Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free\nspeech or even protected speech as practiced by almost \nevery American seems to involve the ability to communicate\nan idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directing\na specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience\nthat has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical \neffects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person. \n\nI think Bill Neel of Butler needs to go back to school\nas obviously he must have been sleeping in his civics\nclass or else they didn't teach civics in mini-guantanamo, OH\n65 years ago.\n\nGreg\n\n\n"}
