The\nPoles noticed that there were some\npatterns in the messages which were\nonly possible via certain plugboard\nsettings, and so:\n\n> When we have collected several such cards corresponding to different\n> initial signals ..., we place them in a pile so that the squares\n> corresponding to the same daily settings are aligned and shine a\n> light beneath the pile.  Only those squares which let the light\n> through will correspond to possible daily settings.\n\nSo the brute force hardware allowed\nprecalculation of \"optical\" computing\ndevices which then narrowed down the\npossibilities enough for brute force\nto again be used for daily decodes,\nuntil:\n\n> On 10 May, the Germans invaded France and, on the same day, in\n> accordance with the best cryptographic principles, they changed their\n> Enigma procedures in such a way that the 1560 Zygalski sheets, each\n> with their carefully drilled 1000 or so holes, became just so much\n> waste cardboard.\n\n-Dave\n\n::::::\n\n> > \"the first synthetic-aperture-radar processor was optical\"\n\nThis is also easy to believe, given Dr.\nElachi's description of the 1981 Shuttle\nImaging Radar:\n\n> The received signal is recorded on an optical film which is retrieved\n> after landing.  The film ... is then processed in an optical correlator\n> to generate the final image.\n\nwhich makes sense, as one wishes to shift\neach component of the return in proportion\nto its frequency, for which one presumably\nneeds a glorified prism.\n\n> Alternatively, the ... signal can be digitized and then recorded on\n> board or transmitted to the ground via a digital data link.
