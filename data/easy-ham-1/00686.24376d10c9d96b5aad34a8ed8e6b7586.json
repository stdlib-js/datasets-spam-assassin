Ooops, no wait, scratch that.\n\nThere is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not be\nprecisely \"free trade/markets\" -- when Ben Franklin first visited\nEngland he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous.  Ben\nexplained that they used \"Colonial Script\", a kind of barter-dollar,\nand increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment.  The\nBritish bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to\nclamp down on the practice.  Within a few years, the colonies were\nrife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire.\n\nAccording to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political\nparty here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about\ntea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were\nprotesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forces\nthat killed Ned Ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believes\nthey were protesting a tea tax.  The same pamphlet claimed that Canada\nwas also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the\nlate-50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from the\njuristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada.\n\nI've wondered about all this.  Certainly the timeline of the collapse\nof the Canadian economy fits the profile, but there are oodles of\nother causes (for example, spending money like we had 300M people when\nwe only had 20M) Anyone have any further information on this?\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy - garym@teledyn.com - TeleDynamics Communications\n - blog: http://www.auracom.com/~teledyn - biz: http://teledyn.com/ -\n  \"Computers are useless.
