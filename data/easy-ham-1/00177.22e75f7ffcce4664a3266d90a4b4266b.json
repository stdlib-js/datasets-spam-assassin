There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon\nproducts derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as\na replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -\nthere is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,\nbut this is to replicate materials that have been previously created \nmuch more easily within the petrochemical industry.\n\nVegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower\noil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world \nwar, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from\nwaste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. \n\nJay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as \npetroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication \nof the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously\nbeing developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately \nmatching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock\noil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the\ngap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to \ncope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.\n\nMy big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.\nRe-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals\n(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely \ndifficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the\npetrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect\nthat, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,\njust at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,\nfor example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.\n\nAll we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling\nlike pig farms and fish and chip shops...\n\nRobin Hill, STEAMY BESS, Brough, East Yorkshire\n\n\n\n********************************************************************\nThis email and any attachments are confidential to the intended\nrecipient and may also be privileged.
