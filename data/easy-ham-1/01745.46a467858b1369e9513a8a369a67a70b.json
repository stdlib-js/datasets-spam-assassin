I'm tossing \nup using either hammie or spamassassin to do the initial sort  - previously\nI've used various forms of 'grep' for keywords and a little gui thing to \npop a message up and let me say 'spam/ham', but that's just getting too, too\ntedious.\n\nI can't make it available en masse, but I will look at finding some of\nthe more 'interesting' uglies. One thing I've seen (consider this \n'anecdotal' for now) is that the 'skip' tokens end up in a _lot_ of the \nf-ps.\n\nAnthony\n"}
