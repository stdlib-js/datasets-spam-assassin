The strangest implied claim there is that it hates MIME\nindependent of HTML.  For example, the spamprob of 'content-type:text/plain'\nin that pickle is under 0.21.  'content-type:multipart/alternative' gets\n0.93, but that's not a killer clue, and one bit of good content will more\nthan cancel it out.\n\nWRT hating HTML, possibilities include:\n\n1. It really had to do with something other than MIME/HTML.\n\n2. These are pure HTML (not multipart/alternative with a text/plain part),\n   so that the tags aren't getting stripped.  The pickled classifier\n   despises all hints of HTML due to its c.l.py heritage.\n\n3. These are multipart/alternative with a text/plain part, but the\n   latter doesn't contain the same text as the text/html part (for\n   example, as Anthony reported, perhaps the text/plain part just\n   says something like \"This is an HMTL message.\").\n\nIf it's #2, it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize()\nmeaning \"even if it is pure HTML, strip the tags anyway\".  In fact, I'd like\nto do that and default it to True.  The extreme hatred of HTML on tech lists\nstrikes me as, umm, extreme <wink>.\n\n> So I guess I'll have to retrain it (yes, you told me so :-).\n\nThat would be a different experiment.  I'm certainly curious to see whether\nJeremy's much-worse-than-mine error rates are typical or aberrant.\n\n"}
