Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about \nlife on Earth today.\n\nThe following is a fascinating document of official Government policy \nthat bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in \nan imperfect world.\n\n>  The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations.

And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and \ntaking share from every other government broadcaster.\n\nIt is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term \nas it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.\n\nMany of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly \ncentrist.

The document, entitled \"The National Security Strategy of the \nUnited States,\" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of \nthe Administration's policy.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTHE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and \ntotalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of \nfreedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, \ndemocracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only \nnations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and \nguaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the \npotential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People \neverywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; \nworship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own \nproperty; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom \nare right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of \nprotecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of \nfreedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.\n\nToday, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military \nstrength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our \nheritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for \nunilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that \nfavors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies \ncan choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and \neconomic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the \nworld to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace \nagainst threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace \nby building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the \npeace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\n\nDefending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental \ncommitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed \ndramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great \nindustrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of \nindividuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less \nthan it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to \npenetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies \nagainst us.\n\nTo defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- \nfrom better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and \ncutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global \nreach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help \nnations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will \nhold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the \nallies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and \ncountries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop \nnew home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every \nturn.\n\nThe gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism \nand technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking \nweapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing \nso with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to \nsucceed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other \nmeans of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, \ncontain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous \ntechnologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America \nwill act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We \ncannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must \nbe prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence \nand proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who \nsaw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have \nentered, the only path to safety is the path of action.\n\nAs we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic \nopportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community \nhas the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the \nseventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace \ninstead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers \nfind ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist \nviolence and chaos. The United States will build on these common \ninterests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by \ncommon values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching \nfor its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese \nleaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of \nnational wealth. In time, they will find that social and political \nfreedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage \nthe advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, \nbecause these are the best foundations for domestic stability and \ninternational order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great \npowers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, \ntrade, and cultural advancement.\n\nFinally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend \nthe benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring \nthe hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to \nevery corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us \nthat weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our \nnational interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people \ninto terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and \ncorruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and \ndrug cartels within their borders.\n\nThe United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a \nbetter future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free \ntrade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies \nout of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual \nnations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to \nbuild a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. \nThe United States will deliver greater development assistance through \nthe New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, \ninvest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also \ncontinue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of \nAIDS and other infectious diseases.\n\nIn building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is \nguided by the conviction that all nations have important \nresponsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. \nNations that depend on international stability must help prevent the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international \naid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For \nfreedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.\n\nWe are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, \nbetter world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply \nthe strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed \nto lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade \nOrganization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as \nother long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment \nthese permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations \nare to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to \nrally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.\n\nFreedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of \nevery person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has \nbeen threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the \nclashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and \nit has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity \nholds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all \nthese foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in \nthis great mission.\n\nI. Overview of America's International Strategy\n\n\n\"Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We \nfight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors \nliberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists \nand tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among \nthe great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and \nopen societies on every continent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWest Point, New York\nJune 1, 2002\n\n\n\nThe United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength \nand influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of \nliberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with \nunparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great \nstrength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that \nfavors freedom.\n\nFor most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great \nstruggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and \nequality.\n\nThat great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and \nrace which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and \ndiscredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we \nare by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by \ncatastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must \ndefeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.\n\nThis is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to \ntranslate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, \nand liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a \ndistinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our \nvalues and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help \nmake the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to \nprogress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations \nwith other states, and respect for human dignity.\n\nAnd this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the United States will:\n\n*\tchampion aspirations for human dignity;\n\n*\tstrengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent \nattacks against us and our friends;\n\n*\twork with others to defuse regional conflicts;\n\n*\tprevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our \nfriends, with weapons of mass destruction;\n\n*\tignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and \nfree trade;\n\n*\texpand the circle of development by opening societies and building \nthe infrastructure of democracy;\n\n*\tdevelop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of \nglobal power; and\n\n*\ttransform America's national security institutions to meet the \nchallenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.\n\n\nII. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity\n\n\n\"Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the \nlanguage of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require \ndifferent methods, but not different moralities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWest Point, New York\nJune 1, 2002\n\n\n\nIn pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we \nstand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because \nthese principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation \nowns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and \nmothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live \nfree from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be \noppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of \nthe secret police.\n\nAmerica must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human \ndignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; \nfree speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; \nreligious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.\n\nThese demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served \nus well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, \nfacing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these \ncore principles into their own systems of governance. History has not \nbeen kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and \naspirations of their people.\n\nOur own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in \nour worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of \nIndependence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a \nstronger, but is a freer and more just society.\n\nToday, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And \nwhen openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central \nand eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When \nwe see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in \nthe Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin \nAmerica and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can \nevolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all \ncherish.\n\nEmbodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, \nthe national security strategy of the United States must start from \nthese core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.\n\nOur principles will guide our government's decisions about international \ncooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation \nof resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international \nbodies.\n\nWe will:\n\n*\tspeak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of \nhuman dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to \nadvance freedom;\n\n*\tuse our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who \nstruggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward \ndemocracy are rewarded for the steps they take;\n\n*\tmake freedom and the development of democratic institutions key \nthemes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation \nfrom other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights \nto move toward a better future; and\n\n*\ttake special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience \nand defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.\n\n\nWe will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist \nit.\n\nIII. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent \nAttacks Against Us and Our Friends\n\n\n\"Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have \nthe distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already \nclear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been \nwaged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is \npeaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on \nthe timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of \nour choosing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWashington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)\nSeptember 14, 2001\n\n\n\nThe United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of \nglobal reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or \nreligion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, \npolitically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.\n\nIn many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a \nlasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed \nwithin a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United \nStates will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals \nwith them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who \nknowingly harbor or provide aid to them.\n\nThe struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in \nour history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly \nelusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come \nthrough the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some \nunseen.\n\nToday our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, \nand will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to \nachieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition \nforces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not \nonly this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of \ntrained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South \nAmerica, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.\n\nOur priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist \norganizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, \ncontrol, and communications; material support; and finances. This will \nhave a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.\n\nWe will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a \ncoordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional \ncampaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure \nthe state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial \ntools necessary to finish the task.\n\nThe United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the \nfinancing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of \nfunding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who \nsupport them, deny terrorists access to the international financial \nsystem, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, \nand prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative \nfinancial networks.\n\nHowever, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the \ncumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we \nseek.\n\nWe will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:\n\n*\tdirect and continuous action using all the elements of national and \ninternational power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist \norganizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of \nterrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction \n(WMD) or their precursors;\n\n*\tdefending the United States, the American people, and our interests \nat home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it \nreaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to \nenlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate \nto act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by \nacting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing \nharm against our people and our country; and\n\n*\tdenying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists \nby convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign \nresponsibilities.\n\n\nWe will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international \nterrorism. This includes:\n\n*\tusing the full influence of the United States, and working closely \nwith allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are \nillegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as \nslavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government \ncan condone or support and all must oppose;\n\n*\tsupporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim \nworld, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote \nterrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;\n\n*\tdiminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by \nenlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources \non areas most at risk; and\n\n*\tusing effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of \ninformation and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of \nthose in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.\n\n\nWhile we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also \nstrengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter \nattack.\n\nThis Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization \nsince the Truman Administration created the National Security Council \nand the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity and including a new unified military command and a fundamental \nreordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland \nencompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public \nand the private sector.\n\nThis strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, \nemergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with \nterrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened \nto manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and \nmass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop \nterrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.\n\nWhile our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism \nin today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. \nWherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations \nand state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where \ngovernments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we \nwill match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and \nour allies can provide.\n\nAs we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work \nwith international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as \nnon-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the \nhumanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to \nrebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, \nthreaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists\n\nIn the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are \nultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom \nand fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this \nconflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, \nproductive international relationships and redefining existing ones in \nways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\n\nIV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts\n\n\n\"We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. \nThe magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements \nlook so small.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nBerlin, Germany\nMay 23, 2002\n\n\n\nConcerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional \ndisputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In \nan increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our \nalliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create \nhorrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states \nfalter, the United States will work with friends and partners to \nalleviate suffering and restore stability.\n\nNo doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- \ndirect or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, \nand military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States \nwill approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:\n\n*\tThe United States should invest time and resources into building \ninternational relationships and institutions that can help manage local \ncrises when they emerge.\n\n*\tThe United States should be realistic about its ability to help \nthose who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when \npeople are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.\n\n\nPolicies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will \napply these principles:\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of \nhuman suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state \nof Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance \nto other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace \nfor either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed \nto an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in \npeace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a \ngovernment that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and \ncounts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all \nparties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and \ncomprehensive settlement to the conflict.\n\nThe United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank \nstand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic \ndevelopment, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to \nestablish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If \nPalestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront \ncorruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support \nfor the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nIsrael also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. \nPermanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the \nUnited States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete \nsteps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. \nAs there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw \nfully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent \nwith the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement \nactivity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, \nfreedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians \nto resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial \nrole but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and \nPalestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.\n\nIn South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India \nand Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested \ntime and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and \nPakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a \nconstructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With \nPakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's \nchoice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more \nopen and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to \nbecome one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century \nand has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our \ninvolvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in \nbilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan \nthat can help defuse military confrontation.\n\nIndonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and \nrespect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting \nthe rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to \nemploy the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its \nneighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by \nIndonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.\n\nIn the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with \ncountries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, \nCanada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic \nhemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, \nopportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as \nthe Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States \n(OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of \nthe entire hemisphere.\n\nParts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising \nfrom the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict \nand unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and \nsecurity of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active \nstrategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce \ntheir laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of \ndrugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs \nin our own country.\n\nIn Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist \ngroups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking \nactivities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are \nworking to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat \nillegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective \nsovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic \nsecurity to the Colombian people.\n\nIn Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, \nand desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United \nStates -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- \ncombating global terror. American interests and American principles, \ntherefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an \nAfrican continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. \nTogether with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's \nfragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous \nborders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence \ninfrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.\n\nAn ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars \nspread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions \nof the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to \nconfronting these emerging transnational threats.\n\nAfrica's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that \nfocuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This \nadministration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the \nregion:\n\n*\tcountries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South \nAfrica, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement \nand require focused attention;\n\n*\tcoordination with European allies and international institutions is \nessential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace \noperations; and\n\n*\tAfrica's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations \nmust be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational \nthreats on a sustained basis.\n\n\nUltimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the \nsurest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are \nconflicts over material resources and political access often tragically \nwaged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to \nthe African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a \ncommon responsibility for democratic political systems offers \nopportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.\n\nV. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends \nwith Weapons of Mass Destruction\n\n\n\"The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and \ntechnology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear \nweapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, \neven weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to \nstrike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and \nhave been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the \ncapability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and \nwe will oppose them with all our power.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWest Point, New York\nJune 1, 2002\n\n\n\nThe nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our \nallies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of \nforce, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security \nenvironment has undergone profound transformation.\n\nHaving moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our \nrelationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the \nbalance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear \narsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as \ncounterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were \ninconceivable.\n\nBut new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. \nNone of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power \nthat was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and \nmotivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain \ndestructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest \nstates, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass \ndestruction against us, make today's security environment more complex \nand dangerous.\n\nIn the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue \nstates that, while different in important ways, share a number of \nattributes. These states:\n\n*\tbrutalize their own people and squander their national resources \nfor the personal gain of the rulers;\n\n*\tdisplay no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, \nand callously violate international treaties to which they are party;\n\n*\tare determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with \nother advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively \nto achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;\n\n*\tsponsor terrorism around the globe; and\n\n*\treject basic human values and hate the United States and everything \nfor which it stands.\n\n\nAt the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's \ndesigns were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against \nIran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear \nweapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become \nthe world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested \nincreasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. \nOther rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as \nwell. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has \nbecome a looming threat to all nations.\n\nWe must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients \nbefore they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction \nagainst the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must \ntake full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new \npartnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military \nforces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective \nmissile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence \ncollection and analysis.\n\nOur comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:\n\n*\tProactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend \nagainst the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key \ncapabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce \ncapabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our \nhomeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated \ninto the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of \nour allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed \nadversaries.\n\n*\tStrengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and \nterrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise \nnecessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, \narms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction \nassistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when \nnecessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will \ncontinue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their \nincreased political and financial support for nonproliferation and \nthreat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 \nbillion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step \nforward.\n\n*\tEffective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD \nuse, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of \nWMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such \nweapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading \nenemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States \nmust also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our \nforces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.\n\n\nIt has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of \nthis new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the \nUnited States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have \nin the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy \nof today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be \ncaused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. \nWe cannot let our enemies strike first.\n\n*\tIn the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we \nfaced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an \neffective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of \nretaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states \nmore willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and \nthe wealth of their nations.\n\n*\tIn the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered \nweapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who \nused them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons \nof choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and \nmilitary aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also \nallow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our \nallies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior \nof rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means \nof overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.\n\n*\tTraditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a \nterrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the \ntargeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death \nand whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between \nstates that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to \naction.\n\n\nFor centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer \nan attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves \nagainst forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars \nand international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption \non the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible \nmobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\n\nWe must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and \nobjectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not \nseek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would \nfail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use \nof weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed \nand delivered covertly and without warning.\n\nThe targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian \npopulation, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law \nof warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, \nmass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and \nthese losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired \nand used weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions \nto counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the \nthreat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling \nthe case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if \nuncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To \nforestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United \nStates will, if necessary, act preemptively.\n\nThe United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging \nthreats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. \nYet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek \nthe world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot \nremain idle while dangers gather.\n\nWe will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our \nactions. To support preemptive options, we will:\n\n*\tbuild better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide \ntimely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;\n\n*\tcoordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the \nmost dangerous threats; and\n\n*\tcontinue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to \nconduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.\n\n\nThe purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat \nto the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our \nactions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.\n\nVI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and \nFree Trade.\n\n\n\"When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a \nprivileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever \nenough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in \nbetter health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade \nrevenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nMonterrey, Mexico\nMarch 22, 2002\n\n\n\nA strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing \nprosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth \nsupported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher \nincomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs \neconomic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it \nreinforces the habits of liberty.\n\nWe will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's \nshores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic \npolicies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our \neconomic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of \npolicies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic \ngrowth, including:\n\n*\tpro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business \ninvestment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;\n\n*\ttax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that \nimprove incentives for work and investment;\n\n*\trule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are \nconfident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic \nendeavors;\n\n*\tstrong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most \nefficient use;\n\n*\tsound fiscal policies to support business activity;\n\n*\tinvestments in health and education that improve the well-being and \nskills of the labor force and population as a whole; and\n\n*\tfree trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the \ndiffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and \nopportunity.\n\n\nThe lessons of history are clear: market economies, not \ncommand-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the \nbest way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further \nstrengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for \nall economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the \ndeveloping world.\n\nA return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. \nnational security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies \nfor their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake \nof global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in \ntheir economies are particularly important in this regard, as are \nJapan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of \nnon-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to \nuse our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- \nincluding through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they \nare adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher \nglobal economic growth.\n\nImproving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic \ngrowth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand \nthe productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging \nmarkets and developing countries to make the investments that raise \nliving standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a \nworld in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that \nallow them access to international capital markets and to invest in \ntheir future.\n\nWe are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve \naccess to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will \ncontinue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial \nmarkets. We will work actively with other countries, the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action \nPlan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and \nmore effectively resolving them when they occur.\n\nThe best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from \noccurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing \nso. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy \nconditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on \nachieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, \nexchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.\n\nThe concept of \"free trade\" arose as a moral principle even before it \nbecame a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others \nvalue, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something \nthat you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the \nfreedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free \ntrade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:\n\n*\tSeize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we \nhelped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, \nespecially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for \ncompletion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the \naccession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade \nOrganization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.\n\n*\tPress regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies \nin the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of \nthe Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United \nStates will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, \ntargeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and \ngovernment procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the \npoorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences \nallowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free \ntrade.\n\n*\tMove ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the \nfree trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration \nwill work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and \nSingapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of \ndeveloped and developing countries in all regions of the world. \nInitially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will \nbe our principal focal points.\n\n*\tRenew the executive-congressional partnership. Every \nadministration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with \nCongress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished \nmajority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing \nTrade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for \ndeveloping countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will \nwork with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade \nagreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade \nPromotion Authority.\n\n*\tPromote the connection between trade and development. Trade \npolicies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, \ncompetition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open \nsocieties, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional \nintegration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in \ndeveloping countries. The United States is implementing The Africa \nGrowth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods \nproduced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more \nuse of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue \nto work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer \ncountries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, \nthe most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public \nhealth. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are \nflexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical \nmedicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and \nmalaria.\n\n*\tEnforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. \nCommerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on \nenforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing \ndisputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a \nglobal effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations \nthat needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws \nagainst unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international \ncommunity must be able to address genuine concerns about government \nsubsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which \nundermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.\n\n*\tHelp domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound \nstatutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used \nin the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the \nAmerican steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the \nenforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that \nthe benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American \nworkers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the \nchange and dynamism of open markets.\n\n*\tProtect the environment and workers. The United States must foster \neconomic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with \nwidening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental \nconcerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy \"network\" \nbetween multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the \nInternational Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade \ntalks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.\n\n*\tEnhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security \nand the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our \nallies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and \ntypes of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, \nAfrica, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to \nwork with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient \ntechnologies.\n\n\nEconomic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize \ngreenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing \nthem at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the \nglobal climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse \ngas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such \nemissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 \nyears, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be \nto:\n\n*\tremain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for \ninternational cooperation;\n\n*\tobtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of \nthe most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to \ncompanies that can show real cuts;\n\n*\tdevelop improved standards for measuring and registering emission \nreductions;\n\n*\tpromote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as \nwell as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, \nwhile also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;\n\n*\tincrease spending on research and new conservation technologies, to \na total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change \nby any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's \nbudget; and\n\n*\tassist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas \nemitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and \nresources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and \nbetter path.\n\n\nVII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building \nthe Infrastructure of Democracy\n\n\n\"In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to \nrebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we \nmust also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWashington, D.C. (Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank)\nMarch 14, 2002\n\n\n\nA world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human \nrace lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including \nall of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and \nopportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of \nU.S. international policy.\n\nDecades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic \ngrowth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served \nto prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and \nperpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars \nspent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction \nachieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.\n\nWorking with other nations, the United States is confronting this \nfailure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing \nfor Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and \nthe strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.\n\nThis Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential \nof individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is \nimpossible without the right national policies. Where governments have \nimplemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels \nof assistance. The United States and other developed countries should \nset an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's \npoorest economies within a decade.\n\nThe United States Government will pursue these major strategies to \nachieve this goal:\n\n*\tProvide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of \nnational reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core \ndevelopment assistance given by the United States. While continuing our \npresent programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, \nthese billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge \nAccount for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest \nin their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight \ncorruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest \nin health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and \nenable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward \ncountries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those \nthat have not to implement reforms.\n\n*\tImprove the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development \nbanks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a \ncomprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other \nmultilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of \nthe world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. \ncontributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. \ncontributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the \nWorld Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African \nDevelopment Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing \npoverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially \nin the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral \ndevelopment banks to focus on activities that increase economic \nproductivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, \nand private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant \nmust be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in \ndeveloping countries.\n\n*\tInsist upon measurable results to ensure that development \nassistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's \npoor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that \nmore children are getting a better education, more people have access to \nhealth care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a \nbetter future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure \nthe success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering \nresults. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own \ndevelopment assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral \ndevelopment banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for \nachieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA \nreplenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation \nsystem that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time, \ndonors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the \nachievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. \ncontribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the \nWorld Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this \nprogress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything \nthat these institutions do.\n\n*\tIncrease the amount of development assistance that is provided in \nthe form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants \nis the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, \nparticularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with \never-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA \nagreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the \npoorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, \nsanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress \nby increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development \nbanks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private \nsector to match government efforts by using grants to support \ndevelopment projects that show results.\n\n*\tOpen societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are \nthe real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, \nmost money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and \nforeign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows \nas well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national \nsecurity strategy.\n\n*\tSecure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor \ncountries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics \nlike HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be \nthreatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the \ndeveloped world are necessary but will be effective only with honest \ngovernance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective \nlocal infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new \nglobal fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan \nand its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for \ntreatment and care. The United States already contributes more than \ntwice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the \nglobal fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.\n\n*\tEmphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of \ndemocracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources \nare devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States \nwill increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 \npercent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher \ntraining in Africa. The United States can also bring information \ntechnology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been \ndevastated by AIDS.\n\n*\tContinue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, \nincluding biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields \nin developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. \nUsing sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits \nto the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still \nsuffer from hunger and malnutrition.\n\n\nVIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers \nof Global Power\n\n\n\"We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th \ncentury to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead \nof prepare for war.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWest Point, New York\nJune 1, 2002\n\n\n\nAmerica will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as \nbroad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance \nof power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires \nclear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent \nconsultations among partners with a spirit of humility.\n\nThere is little of lasting consequence that the United States can \naccomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies \nand friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the \nstrongest and most able international institutions in the world: the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its \ninception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European \nsecurity, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world \ntrade.\n\nThe attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself \nrecognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the \nfirst time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the \ntransatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop \nnew structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new \ncircumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, \nhighly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to \nrespond to a threat against any member of the alliance.\n\nThe alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, \ncreating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to \nmission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:\n\n*\texpand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and \nable to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;\n\n*\tensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate \ncombat contributions to make in coalition warfare;\n\n*\tdevelop planning processes to enable those contributions to become \neffective multinational fighting forces;\n\n*\ttake advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of \nscale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that \nthey dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;\n\n*\tstreamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to \nmeet new operational demands and the associated requirements of \ntraining, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations; \nand\n\n*\tmaintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as \nwe take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.\n\n\nIf NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a \npartnership as central to the security and interests of its member \nstates as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common \nperspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to \ntake common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the \nsame time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater \nforeign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to \nclose consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We \ncannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of \ntransatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.\n\nThe attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances. \nAustralia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an \nattack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the \ndispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation \nEnduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented \nlevels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist \nattack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our \nalliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received \ninvaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.\n\nThe war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia \nnot only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and \nready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and \nfriendships, we will:\n\n\n*\tlook to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and \nglobal affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our \nclose defense and diplomatic cooperation;\n\n*\twork with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while \npreparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of \nthe region over the longer-term;\n\n*\tbuild on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we \ncontinue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as \nwe have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;\n\n*\tmaintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our \nallies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic \nenvironment; and\n\n*\tbuild on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with \ninstitutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \nforum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage \nchange in this dynamic region.\n\n\nWe are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power \ncompetition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of \ninternal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all \nthree cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly \nglobal consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.\n\nWith Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based \non a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and \nRussia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on \nStrategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a \ncritical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, \nlong-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United \nStates. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their \ncountry's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- \nneeded to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that \nCold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that \nRussian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.\n\nUnited States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to \nrefocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and \nchallenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the \nglobal war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the \nWorld Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to \npromote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have \ncreated the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security \ncooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will \ncontinue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the \nformer Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable \nneighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration \ninto the Euro-Atlantic community.\n\nAt the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still \ndivide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to \nbuild an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our \nmotives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our \nrelations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market \ndemocracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very \nweakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those \nopportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even \ndecades.\n\nThe United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral \nrelationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests \nrequire a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest \ndemocracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative \ngovernment. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We \nhave a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through \nthe vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest \nin fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.\n\nDifferences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear \nand missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But \nwhile in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about \nIndia, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with \nwhich we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership \nwith India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic \nfuture.\n\nThe United States relationship with China is an important part of our \nstrategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific \nregion. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous \nChina. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. \nYet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst \nfeatures of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the \nnext series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. \nIn pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its \nneighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated \npath that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national \ngreatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is \nthe only source of that greatness.\n\nThe United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing \nChina. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including \nthe current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean \npeninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan \nand have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and \nsimilar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, \nsuch as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the \nwelfare of our citizens.\n\nAddressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become \nmore open with information, promote the development of civil society, \nand enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to \npolitical openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting \nvillage-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national \none-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly \naccountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work \nremains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, \nassemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.\n\nOur important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into \nthe World Trade Organization, which will create more export \nopportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, \nand companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over \n$100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and \nthe WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance \nopenness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic \nprotections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other \nareas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the \nself-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human \nrights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation \ncommitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but \nnot allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.\n\nThe events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for \nrelations between the United States and other main centers of global \npower, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies \nin Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we \nmust develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships \nbecome routine and unproductive.\n\nEvery agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We \ncan build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober \nanalysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices \nthat will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open \nthe path of progress.\n\nIX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the \nChallenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century\n\n\n\"Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch \nits source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, \nand enterprise of our people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWashington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)\nSeptember 20, 2001\n\n\n\nThe major institutions of American national security were designed in a \ndifferent era to meet different requirements. All of them must be \ntransformed.\n\nIt is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. \nWe must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's \nhighest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, \nour military must:\n\n*\tassure our allies and friends;\n\n*\tdissuade future military competition;\n\n*\tdeter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and\n\n*\tdecisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.\n\n\nThe unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their \nforward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most \nstrategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must \nconfront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to \ndeter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on \nhow an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might \noccur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational \nchallenges.\n\nThe presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound \nsymbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our \nwillingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, \nthe United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of \npower that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the \nmany security challenges we face, the United States will require bases \nand stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as \nwell as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment \nof U.S. forces.\n\nBefore the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major \nplanning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate \nacross the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch \nof the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by \ndeveloping assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision \nstrike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. \nThis broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the \nability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure \nU.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. \ninfrastructure and assets in outer space.\n\nInnovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new \napproaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. \nintelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and \ntechnology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is \nrun, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. \nFinally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight \nthe war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a \nwider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of \ncoercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.\n\nWe know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from \nexperience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must \nand will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- \nwhether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United \nStates, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces \nsufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces \nwill be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a \nmilitary build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the \nUnited States.\n\nIntelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense \nagainst terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed \naround the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, \nfixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping \nwith the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of \ntargets.\n\nWe must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to \nkeep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be \nappropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems \nand coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the \ncapabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the \nknowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek \nthe benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and \nto maximize injury.\n\nWe must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide \nintegrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since \nthe threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted \ninside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of \ninformation between intelligence and law enforcement.\n\nInitiatives in this area will include:\n\n*\tstrengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence \nto lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence \ncapabilities;\n\n*\testablishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides \nseamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing \nthe nation and our allies;\n\n*\tcontinuing to develop new methods of collecting information to \nsustain our intelligence advantage;\n\n*\tinvesting in future capabilities while working to protect them \nthrough a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence \ncapabilities; and\n\n*\tcollecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the \ngovernment with all-source analysis.\n\n\nAs the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend \nAmerica's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other \nnations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding \nsufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State \nDepartment takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with \nother governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must \nbe able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations \nand international institutions. Officials trained mainly in \ninternational politics must also extend their reach to understand \ncomplex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public \nhealth, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.\n\nOur diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil \nwars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief \nrequirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build \npolice forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial \ngovernment institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international \ncooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American \nreadiness to play our part.\n\nJust as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out \nto others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to \npublic information efforts that can help people around the world learn \nabout and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of \ncivilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, \na battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas \nand this is an area where America must excel.\n\nWe will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet \nour global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired \nby the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend \nto Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with \nother nations to avoid complications in our military operations and \ncooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral \nagreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will \nimplement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose \nprovisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. \npersonnel and officials.\n\nWe will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the \nright level and allocation of government spending on national security. \nThe United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this \nwar. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for \nthe American people.\n\nToday, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is \ndiminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have \na greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, \nand goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- \nour freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are \nvulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we \nbring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. \nAs time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that \nuntil now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This \nis a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite \nof it.\n\nIn exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and \ninterests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act \napart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we \ndisagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for \nour concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow \nsuch disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with \nour allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.\n\nUltimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the \nskills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of \nour institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, \nentrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that \nenergy. That is where our national security begins.\n\n\n"}
