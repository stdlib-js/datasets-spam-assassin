Cyberspace entertainment only has to be useful to the majority of its \nusers --entertaining. That means it can tolerate a small amount of vandalism \nstill remain useful. This is quite unlike a system required for commerce. We \nstill have a headache of course, but at least we only need to keep the system \naround 90 percent clean, rather than 99.99 percent. Of course weï¿½ll still \nstrive to stamp out corruption, but our system failure threshold is more \nachievable than one might at first assume.\n\n\n"}
