I got a similar check because an\ninsurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been\n$.02.\n\nAlthough they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the\nalternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies\nto have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they\ncould keep it?  For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer\nstarts adding up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\n> bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n> So I get a check from Pac Bell today (SBC as they're called now).\n> Turns out, they went to the trouble of printing out, signing, sealing\n> and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole $0.33.\n> \n> They easily spent more than this just getting the materials together.\n> Why the hell do companies bother to do this crap?
