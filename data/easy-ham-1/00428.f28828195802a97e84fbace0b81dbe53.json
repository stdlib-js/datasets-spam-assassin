There's a company hiring in Mountain View, looking for a few good\nhackers, no Java, no GUI, not even C++ -- just C and Linux and networking\nand good old stuff like that. They just raised a wad of money and they're\nlooking for a few \"really good programmers\", says the CTO. I know him --\nvery smart guy. Drives too fast, though, for what that's worth.\n\nJoe Bob says \"check it out\". I'd be happy to pass on your resume, or you can\nsend it straight to them. Probably won't matter if I pass it on, since I\ndon't know you guys anyway...\n\nhttp://www.netli.com\n\n-- Sherry.\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Joseph S.
