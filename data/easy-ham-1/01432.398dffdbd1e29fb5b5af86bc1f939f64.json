At least that's the report\nI heard on the Razor list in the past...\n\nTheo, does it work now that you /dev/null'd the logfile?\n\n> >    - version number (says \"cvs\")\n> >    - tag tree as \"Rel\" this time too\n\nI won't bother tagging with Rel, IMO; I don't think we should\nrely on the version control system inside our code, so I've just\nput a line in Mail/SpamAssassin.pm instead.   I will of course\ntag with a release *label* though.\n\n--j.\n\n"}
