VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer \nthan I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup \nprocess should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the \nwizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already \nmade. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to \nchange where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and \neverything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the \nWindows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted \nare ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result \nis a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll \nwrite more about what I learned. \n\n  \n\nOne benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to \nhave someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper \nright hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently \ninfested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern. \n\n \n\n[IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/fbsetup.jpg (FogBUGZ 3.0 Setup)]\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"}
