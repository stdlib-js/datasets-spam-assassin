I believe a suitable memorial\nsurrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,\nchildren's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such\nas a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works\nwould be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.\nWhat do you think should done with the space?\n\nJoe Adams\nHillsdale, New Jersey\n\nI dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan\nthat's designed by committee and that's gone through\npublic hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold\nand ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more\npublic space that the public hates, of which there are\nplenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city\nand that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young\nambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the\ntowers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic\nevents occurred in New York that in any other city would\nbe commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and\nhistorical museums and in New York there's barely a\nlittle plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.\nIt's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for\ntheir big chance, and compared to that spirit of\nentrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a\nstatue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's\nTomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President\nGrant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb\nand think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all\nthe things that New York is about. If you want to find\nGrant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New\nYork: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial\ncity. New York is for the young and lively.\n\n\n\n"}
