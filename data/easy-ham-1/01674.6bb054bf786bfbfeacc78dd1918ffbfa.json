Such records\naren't needed when scoring (an unknown word gets a made-up probability of\nUNKNOWN_SPAMPROB).  Such records are only needed for training; I've noted\nbefore that a scoring-only database can be leaner.\n\nIn part the bloat is due to character 5-gram'ing, part due to that the\ndatabase is brand new so has never been cleaned via clearjunk(), and part\ndue to plain evil gremlins.\n\n"}
