As I\nunderstand it, post-1.8x versions of the core bsddb code ship under the\nSleepycat license, which demands that projects using it must be\npublished-source.  This is a problem if we want Spambayes to be fully\nPSF-licensed - if someone wants to take the Spambayes source and fund their\naddictions by creating a commercial, closed-source spam-filter product, the\nPSF license allows that but not if the code relies on bsddb.  Not that I'm\nin favour of people making money from Spambayes (unless it's me 8-) but the\nPSF license does allow for it - it should be all or nothing.  Or do I have\nthis all wrong?\n\nSlightly OT: This has concerned me since PLabs announced that they were\nintegrating bsddb into Python 2.3 - it's going to make it very easy\n(especially on Windows) for someone to write code that uses anydbm, wrap it\nup with Py2exe and ship it under a commercial license, not knowing that\nthey're breaking the Sleepycat license.  They've never heard of Sleepycat\nSoftware or even bsddb - as far as they're concerned, this \"bsddb.pyd\" file\nthat Py2exe tells them they need to ship is just another part of Python,\nlike _socket.pyd or select.pyd.\n\n-- \nRichie Hindle\nrichie@entrian.com\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nSpambayes mailing list\nSpambayes@python.org\nhttp://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/spambayes\n\n\n"}
