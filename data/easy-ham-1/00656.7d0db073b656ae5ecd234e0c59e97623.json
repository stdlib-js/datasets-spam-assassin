It is first recorded as being used by Captain \n> Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: \"I won't thrash you Tom. \n> Shiver my timbers if I do\".\n\nIt seems implausible to me that \"shiver\" here means \"to shake\"; I don't\nrecall seeing the word used transitively in that sense, and web1913\nlists that sense as \"v. i.\", or intransitive.  The transitive sense of\n\"shiver\", which we no longer use but which people used widely in the\n1800s (web1913 doesn't even list it as archaic or obsolete), means\n\"to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow\".\n\nShivering a boat's timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat.\n(Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough,\nleaves you with a sinking boat.)\n\nSo, \"Shiver my timbers if I do,\" can be reasonably interpreted as a more\nvivid way of saying, \"May I die suddenly if I do.\"  The interpretation\nsuggested by Quinion, \"May my boat be damaged,\" neither makes as much\nsense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar.\n\nI've sent a copy of this to Quinion.\n\n\n"}
