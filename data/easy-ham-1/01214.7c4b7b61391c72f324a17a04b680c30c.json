Dumb question: how to backup huge data?\nNetwork backup to another box? I do not have a box with a tape drive, but maybe box\nwith a large HD with much free space could take the backup (oops, I do not have a\nspace computer with a large HD with much free space).\n\nThese media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! Yes I learned that\nused CDs make inexpensive backup copy on the shelf. I do not want to re-rip all\nthis crap again.\n\n--\nThat's \"angle\" as in geometry.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
