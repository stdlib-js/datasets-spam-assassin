Both the drives are faster (10..15 krpm vs. ~7 krpm,\nfaster seek), and the EIDE protocol is ridiculously dumb (queing;\ndisconnect).\n \n> I think you're wrong with recent releases.

Three drives are easy to get \nin. Anything else would require a redesign, and would in nontrivial \nthermal engineering issues.\n \n> A number of vendors are putting the Promise IDE hardware on the\n> motherboard.

However, \nI wouldn't put this into production unless I've had that system hanging in \nthe local rack under simulated load for a half a year.\n\n\n"}
