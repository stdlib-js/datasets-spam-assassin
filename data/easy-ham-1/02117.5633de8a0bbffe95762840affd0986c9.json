I wonder if I'll ever have \n$100 to spend on fonts. (Matthew Carter, I'd be happy to pay you the two cents \nin royalties you probably get for selling $100 worth of fonts.) \n\n*Update:* Kevin Marks[1], who is stupendously incredible for far more things \nthan I can list here points out that Gill Sans (which I was asking for earlier) \nis _included with OS X_. I knew Mac OS X included a lot of great fonts[2], but \nI don't know how I overlooked this. _Awesome!_ \n\nTufte notes: Terrie Miller[3]. \n\nFirst ammendement beer bash. \n\niSync Beta[4] (guess they learned a lesson from iCal) is out.\n\n\n\n[1] http://epeus.blogspot.com\n[2] http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/font.html\n[3] http://www.oreillynet.com/~terrie/tufte/\n[4] http://www.apple.com/isync/\n\n\n"}
