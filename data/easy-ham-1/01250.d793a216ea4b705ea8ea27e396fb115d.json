Wow, maybe 8 to\n10 months, time flys. I didn't look forward to doing that tedious build every time I\nchanged a kernel or something. Matthias has made this a thing of the past! Dude,\nit's a no brainer, use apt-get or just download and install.\n\nWhat's more, OSS is fully \"imitated\", older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam.\nMy personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better (alsaplayer, xmms\nwith alsa module) to my ear.\n\nThe 2 things that trick people are the modules.conf file, they didn't have that\nautomatic matrix page when I started with alsa, you don't know how good you have it.\n\nAnd on my old installs (only the first time I installed it on a clean box), alsa\nalways was \"muted\" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. It's possible\nMatthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1st\ninstall, that was a long time ago for me.\n\nThose ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, but\nit's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel.\n\n--\nThat's \"angle\" as in geometry.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
