You have \n    to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don't have to \n    give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry, \n    that's just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle \n    and you walk up to them -- you don't try to avoid these guys; you don't try \n    to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big \n    handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, \"Hey, great to see you. \n    You're my new best friend for the next five minutes.\" \n\n    GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman. \n\n    RALL: It's exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes. You offer them a \n    cigarette, and you say, \"Hey, what's goin' on? How's it goin'? Great. \n    Here's my documents. How's the road?\" Just small talk, because these guys \n    are bored. They're in the middle of nowhere, and you're sometimes the only \n    vehicle they've seen for many hours. They're often very drunk, so you just \n    have to be cool.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2]\n\n[1] http://www.tcj.com/247/i_rall.html\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/16/H/de7BfPnMekg\n\n\n"}
