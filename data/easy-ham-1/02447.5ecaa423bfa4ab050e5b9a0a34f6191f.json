Wallace, 83\nBigfoot Story Teller\n(1919-2002)\n\nRay Wallace, a controversial figure involved in 44 years of Bigfoot-related\nevents, died November 26, 2002, in Toledo, Washington.  The Washington State\nconstruction tycoon had been ill for some time, living in a Toledo rest\nhome.\n\nIt was at Bluff Creek, California, in 1958, which found Ray Wallace�s\ncompany building a new road through the northern California forest.   In\nAugust through October, Wallace Construction Company's employee Jerry Crew\nfound tracks of a huge humanlike foot.  Thanks to instructions from\ntaxidermist Bob Titmus, Crew made the first plaster casts of a footprint\nfrom this hairy upright creature his fellow workers called �Bigfoot.�  Crew\ntook the cast to town, to quiet local ridicule, and showed it to a Humboldt\nCounty newspaper editor.  The photograph of Jerry Crew with the giant\nplaster of Paris foot imprint went out over the newswires.   It produced a\nrevolutionary shift from small regional stories of Sasquatch to today�s\nglobal awareness of Bigfoot. Soon after the publicized Crew finds, Wallace\nand his brother claimed other Bigfoot activity around the construction site;\nWallace said he found tracks and droppings of Bigfoot.\n\nWallace was to be involved with the local tales of hairy giants for the rest\nof his life.  Allegedly in the later in the 1950s, for example, Wallace\noffered to sell Texas millionaire Tom Slick a captured Bigfoot.  Wallace\nfailed to produce the creature when Slick came up with an offer. Down\nthrough the years, Wallace would carry on pranks, be tied to carved fake\nSasquatch feet, and produce and try to sell dubious photographs and films.\nHe was a great letter writer and would pen long passages to magazine editors\nabout this photographs or telling of how he knew a Bigfoot was nearby\nguarding a mine full of gold.  After awhile, most Bigfoot hunters and\nresearchers took Wallace as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales. Through\nhis contributions to Strange Magazine, the Track Record, and indirectly to\nFate Magazine, Wallace relished keeping his name in the limelight of the\nBigfoot mystery.\n\nIn March 1998, Ray Wallace offered a million dollars to the first person who\ncould bring him a live baby Bigfoot.  Saying he had tracked Bigfoot for\nforty years, Wallace claimed he wanted to raise a young Sasquatch to\nadulthood. Wallace told reporters he planned to raise a baby Bigfoot with\n�care and respect� and would like to train the creature to ride around with\nhim in his pickup truck and help out with chores around his ranch.  No one\ncame forth with a baby Bigfoot.\n\nRay Wallace added an intriguing, mostly harmless story-telling element to\nthe otherwise often serious pursuit of Bigfoot that various friends of his,\nsuch as Ray Crowe, Director of the International Bigfoot Society, enjoyed.\n\nRay Wallace was interred at the Lone Hill Cemetery in Toledo, Washington\nState, on November 30, 2002.\n\n�Loren Coleman 2002\nhttp://www.lorencoleman.com\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nforteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
