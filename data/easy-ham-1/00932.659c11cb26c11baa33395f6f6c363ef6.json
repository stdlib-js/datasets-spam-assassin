On the social level, the law of averages works to societies\nbenefit in a manner it can't for an individual.\n\nA key reason, in this view, that the US wound up outperforming England\nwas that the English investors were too rational for their societies own\ngood.\n\n(Except, of course, when US investors were bilking them to build canals\nand railroads over here.
