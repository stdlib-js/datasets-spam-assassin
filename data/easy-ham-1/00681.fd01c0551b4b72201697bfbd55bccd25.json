I moved to New Orleans \nyesterday, and I should be flying to DC in about a month to start the \nAmeriCorps training.  I'll be setting up a community technology center which \nwill be used to teach computer literacy skills to low income folks (just, \nlike, learning MS shit (yeah yeah, wtf am i doing?  I know.))  so that \nthey can possibly find better jobs.  I'm sure I'll be doing all sorts \nof other things too, like helping folks with their taxes, writing grants, \netc.  The website is www.americorps.org.  There are -all- sorts of jobs \nall over the country, so if someone out there can survive on the small \nsalary, it's something s/he might want to take a look at.  \n\nSince Xi is in college and getting grants + scholarship + child support \nfrom dad, my load has gone down terrifically.  The IRS is after me for \nmoney I didn't make on the stock market, so it's a way to at least get \ninto a situation where they will have to understand that yes, they will \nhave to wait.  \n\nBut bottom line benefit and motivation is the feelgood that ya get when \nyou do this type of job.  I'm up for some of that.\nCindy\n\n-- \n\"I don't take no stocks in mathematics, anyway\" --Huckleberry Finn\n\n\n"}
