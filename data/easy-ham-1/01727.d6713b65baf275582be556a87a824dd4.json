I didn't have the summary files so I regenerated them using a\nslightly different set of data.  Here are the results of enabling the\n\"received\" header processing:\n\n    false positive percentages\n        0.707  0.530  won    -25.04%\n        0.873  0.524  won    -39.98%\n        0.301  0.301  tied\n        1.047  1.047  tied\n        0.602  0.452  won    -24.92%\n        0.353  0.177  won    -49.86%\n\n    won   4 times\n    tied  2 times\n    lost  0 times\n\n    total unique fp went from 17 to 14 won    -17.65%\n\n    false negative percentages\n        2.167  1.238  won    -42.87%\n        0.969  0.969  tied\n        1.887  1.372  won    -27.29%\n        1.616  1.292  won    -20.05%\n        1.029  0.858  won    -16.62%\n        1.548  1.548  tied\n\n    won   4 times\n    tied  2 times\n    lost  0 times\n\n    total unique fn went from 50 to 38 won    -24.00%\n\nMy test set is different than Tim's in that all the email was received\nby the same account.  Also, my set contains email sent to me, not to\nmailing lists (I use a different addresses for mailing lists).  If\npeople cook up more ideas I will be happy to test them.\n\n  Neil\n"}
