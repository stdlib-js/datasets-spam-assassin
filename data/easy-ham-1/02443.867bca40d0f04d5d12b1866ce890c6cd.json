Col. Michael Humm, a Pentagon spokesman, said the incident happened\nWednesday and that the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado\nSprings, Colo., was continuing to investigate. \n\nThe reported contrail stirred concern because of the possibility that it\ncould have indicated the presence of an unauthorized jet aircraft in or\napproaching American airspace. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the\nPentagon has taken greater precautions to monitor U.S. airspace. \n\nA contrail is created by vapor from a jet engine in the presence of cold\nair. \n\nThe jets that were scrambled to attempt to intercept and identify the source\nof the contrail found nothing, said Lt. Cmdr. Curtis Jenkins, a NORAD\nspokesman. He said NORAD had developed no new information since the initial\nreport at 4 p.m. EST on Wednesday. NORAD is reviewing data from its tracking\nradars in search of evidence, he said. \n\nA Pentagon statement said NORAD received unverified reports of ``what\nappeared to be a contrail of unknown origin,'' originally in the vicinity of\nthe Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. \n\n``Initially, it was reported to be heading northwestward toward the United\nStates,'' the statement said. ``Commercial airline pilots later reported the\ncontrail over Florida and later over Indiana. Thereafter, no other sightings\nwere reported.'' \n\nThe reported contrail was never verified by visual or radar contact, the\nPentagon statement said. \n\nAt the Federal Aviation Administration, spokesman Paul Turk said, ``I'm\naware of the reports.'' He referred all questions to NORAD. \n\nJenkins said he was not sure who reported the initial sighting over the\nCaribbean. He also was unsure who requested NORAD to launch fighter jets or\nfrom which military bases they were scrambled. \n\n``We don't necessarily judge or second-guess when a request comes to us to\ninvestigate'' a contrail, he said. \n\nMeanwhile, reports of a ball of fire streaking across the sky early Thursday\nhad people throughout the Northwest flooding radio and television stations\nwith calls reporting a meteor shower. \n\nIt was believed that the light came from a Russian rocket body re-entering\nthe Earth's atmosphere about 6:15 a.m. The U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha,\nNeb., and the North American Aerospace Defense Command confirmed a Russian\nrocket fell back to Earth, but gave no further details. \n\n\nAP-NY-11-28-02 1833EST\n\nCopyright 2002, The Associated Press.
