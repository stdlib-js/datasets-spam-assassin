It correctly recognized a spam that slipped through SA.\nBut it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any\nMIME structure or HTML parts, and several messages in my saved 'zope\ngeeks' list that happened to be using MIME and/or HTML.\n\nSo I guess I'll have to retrain it (yes, you told me so :-).\n\n> Just in case <wink>, I\n> uploaded a new version just now.
