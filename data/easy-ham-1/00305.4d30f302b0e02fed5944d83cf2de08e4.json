Hettinga\nSunday, August 25, 2002\n\n(BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs.\nPatriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war\nbetween thugs.\n\nPut crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang\nwere the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha's \"family\" were, of\ncourse, the (mostly) Italian thugs.\n\n\nThink Scorsese's upcoming \"Gangs of New York\", only with\ncounter-reformatory overtones. Hoover's South Boston \"social-club\"\nputsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in\nhindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite\na reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by\nthe Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not\nfor New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US,\nonly makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to\nits ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime\nthere once and for all.\n\nThe result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of\nItalian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was,\nposthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine\n- -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence\nin Whitey Bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston's drug markets,\nlike the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other\nalso-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of\nmagnitude, not mere percentage points.\n\nAs Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. And, make\nno mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that \"quality\"\nof carnage, nation-wide.\n\n\nSo, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one\ngang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at\nleast, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with\napparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on\nthe gears of \"justice\" like so much hamburger.\n\nHowever, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was\n\"greasing\", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could\nlove: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence --\non paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door,\nbut still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken's famous \"bluenoses\nand busybodies\".\n\n\nIt all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of\nbeginnings. What she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy\nthen tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a\nsmaller, \"manageable\" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more\nheads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition,\nin more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.\n\nEvery time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or\nharmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now,\napparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing\nhappened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead\nyears. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely\nlucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently\nscale newly-legislated \"barriers to competition\" imposed on them by\nthe state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of\nthose substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of\nevil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly\ncoercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred\nliberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.\n\nAs Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need\ngovernment if nobody's breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to\nParkinson's Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people,\nbreaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they\nconfiscate at tax time.\n\nAnd, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably\necho here his father Milton's famous observation that government\nregulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and\nnever the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even,\n*especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in\nthe increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our\ngovernment now imposes on us.\n\n\nAnd there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati.\n\nIn fact, Hayek himself, in \"The Road to Serfdom\", couldn't have\npredicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover's blatant\nimposition, \"for our own good\", of Vietnam-era statist power at the\nneighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn't have had\nbetter \"useful idiots\" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an\nabsolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover.\n\nUseful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who\nwere eating out of Hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middle\nof the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger's hand, whether they knew it\nor not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you'll notice, which\nsaw the increasingly steady imposition of \"mob\" violence, and market\ncontrol, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the\nimaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting,\nmovie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little\nCaesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now\nstrictly political, descendents.\n\nIn terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr.\nSalvati and the others, dead or alive, as a \"transfer-price\", in\nhuman lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style\nVietnam-era Keynesian \"social-cost\" input-output accounting at its\nmost despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that\nwas committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic\ncontrol, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a\nrace war between thugs up in Boston.\n\n\nThis shouldn't be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least\nfought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and\nendorsed, at the time, by all the \"right\" people, for all the \"right\"\nreasons.\n\nAs far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson's observation\nthat a \"prince\" is just a stationary bandit.\n\nThough, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and,\nwhat's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of\npeople of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J.\nEdgar Hoover a bandit \"princess\", instead.\n\n\"Bandit Queen\", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens --\nand real bandits -- everywhere.\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n- ---------\n\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/national/25FBI.html?todaysheadlines=\n&pagewanted=print&position=top\n\n\nThe New York Times\nAugust 25, 2002\nHoover's F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX\nBUTTERFIELD\n\nBOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar\nHoover's war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional\ninvestigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of\nNew England's organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca.\n\nTwo gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr.\nPatriarca's permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan,\n\"as they were having a problem with him,\" according to an F.B.I. log\nof the conversation. \"Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,\" the\nF.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an\nalley, shot six times.\n\nIt was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known\ngangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England\nMafia was involved.\n\nBut when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real\nkillers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were\nleft alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to\ndeath or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing\nto do with it.\n\nOne, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with\nthe Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I.\nfor $300 million for false imprisonment.\n\nHis is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the\nJustice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled,\ncorrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.'s Boston\noffice in its effort to bring down the mob.\n\nThe lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years\nin a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of\nthe most explosive evidence has only recently come to light,\nincluding documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca\napproved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation\nby the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the\ndepartment into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston.\n\nThe documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently\nincluding Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents\nwere employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were\nprotecting them from prosecution.\n\n\"J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal\nhimself,\" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati's lawyer. \"He allowed a\nwitness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect\none of his informants.\"\n\nMr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and\nmay have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark\nwho worked for Mr. Barboza.\n\nAsked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr.\nSalvati's innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a\nspokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the\npending litigation.\n\nA Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate\nmisconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the\ninvestigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting\nsentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and\nobstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were\nF.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and\nStephen Flemmi are brothers.\n\nThe Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton,\nRepublican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston\noffice to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau's knowledge\nthat Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr.\nDeegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime,\nincluding who fired the first shot.\n\nThen, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover's office demanded to know what\nprogress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer.\n\nIn a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston\noffice said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot\nwounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca \"potentially\ncould be an excellent informant.\"\n\nThe agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have\nkilled seven men, \"and, from all indications, he is going to continue\nto commit murder.\" Nevertheless, the agent said, \"the informant's\npotential outweighs the risk involved.\"\n\nA Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. \"The most\nfrightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi's murders,\nthe director does not even respond,\" the investigator said. \"There is\nno message not to use a murderer as a government informant.\"\n\nThe origin of the corruption scandal was public and political\npressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing\npower of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I.\nagents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties\nto a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr.\nBulger.\n\nBoth sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and\nthe trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually\nhelped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled\norganized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger's gang was able to take\nover the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while\nthe F.B.I. looked the other way.\n\nOne reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr.\nPatriarca's involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional\ninvestigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device\nin his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who\ntranscribed the conversation made it appear that the information was\ncoming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device,\nthe investigators say.\n\nMr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted\nin 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on\nparole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state\njudge after the Justice Department task force made public documents\nsuggesting his innocence.\n\nTwo of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their\nsurvivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million\nlawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to\ndie in the electric chair. His life was spared only when\nMassachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974.\n\nMr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston's North End with\nhis wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30\nyears. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put\non the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each\nother.\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPWmB2sPxH8jf3ohaEQL9qgCgxHq0ee06UEsNv8u8wgvmjf9K7S4An3Rb\n3srsGomWjNDwIaKoEHOfNHpI\n=OELD\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
