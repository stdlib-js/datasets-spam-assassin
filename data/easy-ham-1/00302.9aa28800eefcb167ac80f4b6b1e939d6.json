It's just that KnowNow is waaay to small of a part of their $7.2B portfolio... so far!\n\nRohit\n\nkhare@alumni.caltech.edu\n\n\nTexas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to Spend\n\nAugust 25, 2002\nBy RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG \n\n\n\n\n \n\nIt was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when\nhe became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways\nlast March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner\nand meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and\nrenegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped\nthrough his files and found the number for the Texas\nPacific Group, an investment firm headed by David\nBonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation\nfor fixing problem companies. \n\nMr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,\nhad watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of\n$66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed\nfor bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600\nmillion. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in\nAmerica West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. \n\nThat search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let\nTexas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? asked\nRichard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.\nSiegel reached. \n\nIn June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And days\nbefore US Airways announced its plans to file for\nbankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiated\nabout $550 million in concessions with its unions - Texas\nPacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed to\nkick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep\nthe company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed to\nbuy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,\nand take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges\nfrom bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with a\nbetter offer. \n\n\"One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks\nwere,\" said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, in\nan interview after the bankruptcy filing. \"There aren't\nmany people around with the stomach or the knowledge to\ndelve into the airline industry.\" \n\nTexas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying\nbusinesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman\nmade their names during the recession of the early 1990's\nwith investments in Continental and America West. The\nfirm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping\ncompanies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its\nextensive network of contacts for talented replacements. \n\nNow the partners are again looking for trouble. In the last\nyear alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed six\nacquisitions, most in unloved industries like\nsemiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,\nit announced plans to buy Burger King, which has been\nlosing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also bidding\nfor Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. \n\nThe most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these\ndeals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November of\nMEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6\n- yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150\nmillion bank loan. \n\nIn the last few years, most firms that specialize in\nleveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans and\nother borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -\nhave been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have made\nmanagements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that are\nfor sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. \n\nTexas Pacific is different. \"This is a terrific environment\nfor them,\" said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the\nBlackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. \n\nMark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of the\nWest, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: \"Most\nother buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.\nYou don't see many guys wanting to take on operational\nfixes.\" \n\nLike most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keep\nits inner workings private: its partners rarely grant\ninterviews and its Web site is perpetually under\nconstruction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,\nthe third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for\nthis article. \n\nMr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and\nbright, patterned socks. \"He likes argyle socks, and they\ntend to fall down around his ankles,\" said Henry Miller, an\ninvestment banker who advises troubled companies. Early in\nhis career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bonderman\nargued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. \n\nWhen a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known\nfor obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking\nin places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan.\n\"Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on\nmy caller I.D., I know it's David calling,\" said one\ninvestment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. \n\nMr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the\nchief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.\nMr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making\nearly bets in industries like cable television and taking\nstakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,\nwhich had been seized by the government. Over nearly a\ndecade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annual\nreturn of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. \n\nIn 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.\nCoulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also\nworked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year with\nMr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &\nCompany, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. \n\nThe three men have complementary skills, investment bankers\nand other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the master\nstrategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals and\nthe detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Price\noften recruits managers and advises on operational issues. \n\n\"David is very much the optimist, very much the deal\nmaker,\" said Greg Brenneman, a former president of\nContinental. \"Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.\nHe will sit back and ask the tough questions. He will\napproach investments a little bit more skeptically than\nDavid does.\" \n\nBy the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was well\nestablished in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion\nfrom pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To\ncelebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented San\nFrancisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at a\nparty. \n\nBut as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific\nhesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no\ndeals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate\nblowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but\nstayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the\nbusinesses untenable. \n\nInstead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing\ninvestments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during\nthat stretch. \n\n\"They started to cash out early in the cycle,\" said Mario\nGiannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money\nmanagement firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific\ninvestors. \n\nThe good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for Texas\nPacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that\nneeded its help. \n\nBut Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the\nrough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health\nmaintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the\nmid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new\nmanagers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a\n$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian\nmotorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than\nquadrupled. \n\nBut Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at\nthe top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 million\ninvestment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for\nwhich it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,\nhas been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of\nBally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand\nfor luxury goods. \n\nTexas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a\nsemiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,\nboth of which filed for bankruptcy. \n\nSome of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's\nperformance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in\ntwo investment funds it raised over the last decade. The\nfirst fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and\nincluding investments made through March 1997, should\nreturn more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific\ninvestor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997\n- could return less than half that, this investor\nestimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on\nthese investments before the stock market sank. \n\nBut because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings\nin the second fund, profits on these investments could\nrebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new\nmanagement in place, J. Crew will turn around as the\neconomy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, \"their\nreturns look pretty good when you consider that some other\nfunds won't return any capital\" to investors. \n\nBut with the weak economy throwing many companies into\ntrouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier\nsuccess, the investor said. \"They should do exceptionally\nwell,\" he said. \n\nTexas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. It\nrelies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure\ntroubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except\nfor surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it\nreplaces managers. \n\nLess than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,\nfor example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his\nold friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it\nto the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. \n\nContinental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then\nbrought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and\nin October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief\nexecutive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul\nof the company and is now considered a great turnaround\nartist of the industry. \n\n\"The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with Bob\nFerguson,\" said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for\nthe Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the\nthinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982\nBraniff bankruptcy. \"He chose Bethune over his longtime\nfriend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a\nbetter job.\" \n\nAt America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more\nextensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was\nled by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. \n\nW. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.\nCoulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job of\nchief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.\nParker said the two men quickly realized they had \"somewhat\nkindred spirits.\" \n\nThe board replaced most senior managers at America West,\nexcept William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped\ndown last September. His restructuring plan had made the\nairline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from\nbankruptcy in August 1994. \n\nTexas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth\nabout $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and\nthe group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. \n\n\"These are not passive investors, nor am I,\" said Donald L.\nSturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental's\nboard with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. \"You're active.\nYour money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake.\" \n\nAfter overseeing managers who worked successfully with\nunions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has a\ngood reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways\nwas interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris\nChiames, a spokesman for the airline. \n\nMr. Siegel wanted an investor who would \"be as labor\nfriendly as possible,\" Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways can\nstill entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, the\nbillionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressed\ninterest. \n\nTexas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made with\nGoldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two\nyears of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and the\nchain's franchisees - even before the company, which had\nbeen owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up for\nsale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the National\nFranchisee Association, which represents most Burger King\nfranchisees. \n\n\"We liked what they had to say about the human component of\nthe businesses they buy,\" Mr. Josephson said. Many other\nowners, he added, \"are dismissive of labor.\" \n\nAt Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with an\nexecutive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is John\nDasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,\nwho met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwest\nbought out their stake in Continental in 1998. \n\nUnlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamored\nwith the technology industry, despite the failure of so\nmany start-ups the last two years. It has focused on the\nsemiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is\nhighly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. \n\nThe firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,\nwhich makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,\nhas been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two and\ntook both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most of\nits stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much larger\ninvestment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chip\nmaker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in\nAsia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed for\nbankruptcy last year. \n\nTexas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third\ncompany, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6\nbillion three years ago. It invested $100 million more last\nyear. \n\nIts latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,\nmay prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing the\npayment to E.On, based in D�sseldorf, Germany, was actually\nmore than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal\nsaid. \n\nTexas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Company\nof the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed to\nguarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. Texas\nPacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of\nwhich it swapped for more stock in the company. \n\n\"They did a good job of timing the acquisition,\" said\nNabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who noted\nthat in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit\nsince the fourth quarter of 2000. \n\nBut Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearly\nsizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, America\nWest and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,\nthe catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. \n\nTwo years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discount\nticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75\nmillion in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to\ninvest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.\nHotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as\nPriceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site\nbut does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until\nafter the sale. \n\nThe contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt\nHotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said that\nthe company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific\nremains committed to it. \n\nLast spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen to\ntalk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bonderman\nseemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the\nsteep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk,\nMr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain,\nMr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet. � \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/business/yourmoney/25TEXA.html?ex=1031278887&ei=1&en=05fca479b8bcee6b\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
