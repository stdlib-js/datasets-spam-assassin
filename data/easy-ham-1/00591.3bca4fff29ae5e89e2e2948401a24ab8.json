Of course, 'sophisticated' and 'Western\nCivilization' are essentially equivalent IMHO.

Hindu extremism isn't about the Hindu\nreligious theology as far as I can see.  It is a peg to hang an ethnic\nidentity and identity politics on.\n\nMuslim extremism appears to have a far greater connection to theology.\n\n> 'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and\n> cloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and\n> religiously divided.

That and the introduction of potatoes saved the Irish as\nIrish.\n\n> That's fine, as it would be an inappropriate concentration.
