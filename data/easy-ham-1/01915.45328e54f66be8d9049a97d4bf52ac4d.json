That was pretty good. My heart \nwas racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive \nultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head \nwith blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not \ndiseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general \nartery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they \nwere sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the \nheart). \n\nNow there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very \nwell. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I \nasked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does \nit mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really \nnot much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the \nones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an \nangiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass \nbecause of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part \nof my heart not working, but what can you do about it?\n\n[1] http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&q=carotid+arteries&spell=1\n[2] http://www.vascularweb.org/doc/190\n\n\n"}
