What it boils down to is that\nonly the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. \nWhat I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively\nstill exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top\nexecutive and management positions in the major French firms and the\ngovernment, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not\nofficially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws\nand legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. \nEven for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them\nfrom branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many\ncan leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about\nthe French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about\nit (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect\nthis may hold true for other European countries as well.  \n\nAfter all those \"revolutions\", France is still nothing more than a\nthinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\n"}
