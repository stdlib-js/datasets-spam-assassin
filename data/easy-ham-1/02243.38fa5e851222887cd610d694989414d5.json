Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with \nremarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that \nreading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be \nhonest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind \nthat. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the \ntilde. \n\nEvery command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for &#8220;home \ndirectory&#8221;, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username \nwill take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to \ntheir Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can \ntrace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal \npages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to \nhave their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more \ncommonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html \nsubdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point \nyour browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files \nfrom that user's Sites directory within their home directory. \n\nBut I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. \n\nAs with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in \nthis field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (\nold habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene \nWallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a \ntilde. \n\nIn fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be \nused in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a \ntilde in its URL. \n\nClearly, the tilde is underappreciated. \n\nDigging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn \nthat the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd \ncharacter called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if \nindeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, \nto be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. \nThe tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the &ntilde; \n(now referenced in HTML as the named entity &ntilde;), but somewhere along \nthe line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky \nuses. \n\nDigging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for \n#[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came \neven later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, \n1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee \nmeeting, when it was proposed &#8220;as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease \nSHARE&#8221;. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or \nwhat this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, \nwhen the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. \n\nAnd now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of \nyesterday called &#8220;Deja News&#8221;, and kids today call &#8220;Google \nGroups&#8221;), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William \nSafire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially \npronounced &#8220;squiggle&#8221;. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary\n[10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was \ncool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various \nASCII characters. \n\nAs early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem\n[11]. \n\nIn July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. \n\nIn February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that \nFidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. \n\nAs early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. \n\nAs early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. \n\nIn November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements \n(history,tilde,job control)[16]. \n\nAs early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed \nin the APL-11 character set[18]. \n\nIn April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying \nbugs in csh). \n\nIn December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced &#8220;tilde&#8221;[20], prompting \nthis typographical pun[21]. \n\nAnd that's the earliest reference I can find. \n\nSo where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but \nthere are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the \ntilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for \n&#8220;home directory&#8221;? When did it migrate into the world of web servers \nto provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web \nsites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing \nmy research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. \nMay you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.\n\n\n\n[1]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/\n[2]  http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/personal/bokonon.html#words\n[3]  http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/03.html#when_an_engineer_flaps_his_wings\n[4]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/tilde.html\n[5]  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3627ac95.66099519%40news.cs.hut.fi\n[6]  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=an_600051281\n[7]  http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/latin1/ascii-hist.html#7E\n[8]  http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso646.html\n[9]  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=735627391.AA02027%40Clone.his.com\n[10] http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/a/ASCII.html\n[11] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=14595%40shlump.nac.dec.com\n[12] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=CMM.0.88.616446576.cmg%40watsun.cc.columbia.edu\n[13] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=4036%40hoptoad.uucp\n[14] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=669%40kodak.UUCP\n[15] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3197%40jhunix.UUCP\n[16] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=2428%40cal-asd.fluke.UUCP\n[17] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=778%40brl-bmd.UUCP\n[18] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=2405%40decwrl.UUCP\n[19] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bnews.ucf-cs.904\n[20] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bnews.ucbcad.162\n[21] http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bnews.hp-pcd.546\n\n\n"}
