For what this is worth,\nI would claim they're considerably more promiscuous on the average than\nyour average het. My utterly unscientific, unsubstatiated claim is that\nthe typical male would *like* to be considerably more promiscous than your\naverage female (ay, and here's the rub. pray don't forget the kleenex).  \nLook up different reproduction strategies, due to basic hardware\ndifference (sexual dimorphism). You'd do that too if it happened to you.\n\nOnce you go past the first three of four pages of hysterical propaganda on\nGoogle you might actually run into real studies. Anyone game?

I'm way overposting\ntoday, but I find this entire exchange hee-lay-rious. \n\n\n"}
