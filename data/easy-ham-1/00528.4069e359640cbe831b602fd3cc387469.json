The cost\nis a \"minimum $500 per year\"... but that only accounts for 18 people\nstreaming and playing like 13 or 14 songs an hour. But we could maybe manage\nthe 2 cents per person, per 100 songs.\n\nThe problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming.\nStart and end times for every song (not too hard), artist (okay), title\n(okay), composers (a little harder), serial number (wtf??). I think there\nare a few more things they wanted, but honestly, programming this info in\nfor every song that we play is ridiculous. This means we'd also have to get\nall the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play a\nrequest, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous and\nnearly impossible...\n\nWe would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info -\nwhich sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't have\nserial numbers and barcodes. Then still if only the magic 18 people\nwebstream our signal, the price would become quite exponential since we play\non average 16 songs an hour, we'd be paying $22.11 everyday to stream to\nthose 18 people. So really, it does have to do with the internet tax, but it\nis a few reasons together why we can't do it after their kill-date. :(\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSent using Phorum software version 3.2.6 <http://phorum.org> \n\n\n"}
