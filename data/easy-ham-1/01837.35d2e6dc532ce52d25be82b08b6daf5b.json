People drove for hours just to taste \n    our Twinkie,\" said Rocky Mullen, who sells the deep-fried, cream-filled \n    treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of \n    Seattle. \n\n    As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add \n    chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top... \n\n    Hearing about Mr. Sell's invention, Hostess, the company that makes the \n    71-year-old snack, started promoting deep-fried Twinkies to state and \n    county fairs, where a captive population of junk-food addicts began \n    gobbling them up between pig races and tractor-pull competitions. \n\n    How bad are they for your health? After deep-frying, a Twinkie packs an \n    estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2]\n\n[1] http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20020923/UFATTN/Headlines/headdex/headdexInternational_temp/13/13/22/\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/PyMFa6sCswPya\n\n\n"}
