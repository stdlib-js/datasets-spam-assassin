At shopping \nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front \nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in \npublic office. While chances are high that we won't know them \npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and \nask for our votes.\n\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it \nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\n\nIn this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State \nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail \naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent \neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\n\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more \nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio \nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of \n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\n\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have \nbeen equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters \nwould have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones \nthrough any of those channels.\n\nThe response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He \nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost \nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been \nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice \n``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.\n\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but \nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign \nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money \nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication \nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\n\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be \nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, \nit's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different \nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\n\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress \nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We \nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or \nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A \nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of \nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be \ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\n\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the \nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them \nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 \npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail \naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\n\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the \nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better \nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient \ngroups.\n\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter \nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without \nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage \nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam \nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. \nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best \nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an \nadvocacy management and communications software company.
