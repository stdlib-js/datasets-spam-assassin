Staring into\nhis empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on an\nunlikely solution: Put a tax--just a \"benign\" dime a shot--on\nespresso.\n\nThat led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents,\nand next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one\nthat taps right into Seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. This is,\nafter all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 pound\nof beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000\nresidents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle\nalso has two other major coffee chains, Tully's Coffee and Seattle's\nBest Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.\n\nA recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the\ntax. \"For people outside of Seattle who don't understand the\nconsumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,\"\nsaid John Burbank, the think tank's executive director, \"but it was\ncommon sense.\"\n\nResearch by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that\npeople preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But\nbecause of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on\nespresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.\n\nBurbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a\nyear. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research\nshows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.\n\nBurbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The\nthink tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of\nlow-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.\n\nBurbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs\nmade earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would\nprovide more low-income families with subsidies for child care,\nimprove preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.\n\nAt Bauhaus Books & Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of\ncustomers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.\n\nEspresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend an\nextra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. \"I'm OK with\nit,\" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. \"The money's got\nto come from somewhere.\"\n\nHope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she\nbrought her own mug) and reading \"Zen and the Art of Pottery.\" She\nsupports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be\nexpected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing on\nthe menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.\n\nSome say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out.\n\nDavid Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a\nday, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. \"I, for\none, don't have kids, but I drink espresso,\" he said, as he sewed a\nleather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. \"I don't mind paying, but I\nthink everyone should pay.\"\n\nCoffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as\nJOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle's\nChamber of Commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises,\nStarbucks and Tully's.\n\nThe tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that\ncontains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare\nfor smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If\nespresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a\ncity audit.\n\nUniversity of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. \n\n\"The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is\nneither,\" he said. \"On the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead\nto costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to\navoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using\nfinely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker]\nand that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be\nright? I don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal\nfees that could have gone to child care.\n\n\"Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious\nidea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They've pitted espresso\ndrinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side with\nthe espresso drinkers?\"\n\nIn fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political\ntwo-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public\nstance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle,\ncorporations continually advertise their commitment to social\nactivism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members\nprefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care.\n\n\"Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and\nchildhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we\ncontribute annually,\" the company said. \"However, Starbucks does not\nunderstand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an\nadditional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single\nconsumer product.\"\n\nThe City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before\nvoters next year. The initiative's authors say it is directed at\nvendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through\nhigher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee.\nThe tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of\nespresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt.\n\nBurbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of\nconsumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's been\npitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime\nevery time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.\n\nIt's the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds\nfunny. \"I drink espresso,\" she said, laughing, \"and I am not rich.\"\n\n\n\n\nJH> \"I did not have sex with that woman.\"\n\n>> -----Original Message-----\n>> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nJH> Mr.\n>> FoRK\n>> Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 2:12 PM\n>> To: FoRK\n>> Subject: Re: Goodbye Global Warming\n>> \n>> \n>> ----- Original Message -----\n>> From: \"John Hall\" <johnhall@evergo.net>\n>> \n>> > A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they\n>> > would have had to invent it.\n>> A Republican once said \"I am not a crook\".\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n\n"}
