They don't mention Nextel, whose \nhullking milspec i700 handset I've been carrying for years now, with incredible \nreception all over the US and Canada. Their front-line customer service sucks, \nbut the prices and network can't be beat. \n\n    T-Mobile is in the midst of a massive makeover. In recent months, the \n    company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta \n    Jones. \n\n    The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche \n    Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received \n    1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the \n    worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate \n    has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements. \n\n    But T-Mobile is the cheapest wireless provider, available, with an average \n    cost of just 8.2 cents per minute. (Verizon, by contrast, costs 14.3 cents \n    per minute.)  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_via Camworld[3]_)\n\n[1] http://www.msnbc.com/news/816517.asp\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/VKy7KfS2A7jUZ\n[3] http://www.camworld.com\n\n\n"}
