I\nhave a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily around\nthe 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them.\n\nAlso, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number.  Since I didn't have\nreal-time data, I typically used the lower or median number of different\nperiods (most recent month, two months, six months), depending on the\ntrend of the period data (better performance for recent messages ->\nfavor recent scores, worse performance for recent messages -> favor\nlowest scores, never pick the highest number unless the rule was very\naccurate and the highest number was for the most recent data).\n\nDan\n\n\n"}
