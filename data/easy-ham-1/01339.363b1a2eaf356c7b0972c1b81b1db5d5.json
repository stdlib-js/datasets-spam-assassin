When I found that patent I\nfound others that were just common sense, things that any geek could implement\nwith his script/shell-language of choice; and it's time for someone to get the\nmedias attention on what's going on.\n Basically this is the new wave of \"namenappers\"; it used to be domainnames,\nnot it's all the basic general ideas they can think off/find on the web that\nthey're patenting.\n\n\n\t/Tony\n-- \n# Per scientiam ad libertatem! // Through knowledge towards freedom! #\n# Genom kunskap mot frihet! =*= (c) 1999-2002 tony@svanstrom.com =*= #\n\n     perl -e'print$_{$_} for sort%_=`lynx -dump svanstrom.com/t`'\n\n\n"}
