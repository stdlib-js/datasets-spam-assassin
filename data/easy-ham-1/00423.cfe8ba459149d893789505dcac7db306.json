She also likes to have control over her environment, and this\nmeans she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting\nthe music playing.\n\nBy watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design\nfrom watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market\nniche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.\n\nThe CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but\ndoesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead\nrequiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI\ndisaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the\nbutton again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever\nget music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a\nsurprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again\nwhen the music doesn't play.\n\nFor toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,\nwithin half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the\nbutton multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't\nchange the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you\npress, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be\nthe same.\n\nThe back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI\ndisaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle\nCDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a\nproblem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,\nthat edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and\nwiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but\nwhich hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it\nhasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to\nunderstand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the\nCD.\n\nTatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is\na mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the\nplayer into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing\nthe play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,\nbut uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and\nFM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the\nbinary distinction of music/no music.\n\nWhat would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start\nplaying a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it\nwould give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.\nThe other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half\nthe size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so\nthere is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.\nThe play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of\nthe player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The\ndevice would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip\nopen at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It\nshould be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'\nwithout affecting the player.\n\n- Jim\n\n\n\n\n"}
