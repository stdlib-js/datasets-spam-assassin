It's a pretty basic \nbrowser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified \nbrowsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 \nand his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time \nslightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla's no tolerance \npolicy for regressions.\n\nWhile this \"line in the sand\" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it \nmisses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to \nadd features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see \nfeatures removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, \nrelying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the \nuser interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last \nfeature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!\n\nYou can really only cram so many features into a product before its size \nrequirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious \nrule. It's like you start with an empty elevator that says \"Capacity: 10 \npeople.\" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of \npeople (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the \nsecond floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it \ncontinues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, \nbut there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of \nthem squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla \nsidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes \nhe'd get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn't. \nSomeone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way \nto the third floor, so he's useless, and everyone wishes he'd get off too. He \ndoesn't though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until \neventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.\n\nWe need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that \nnobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the \nfeatures that didn't work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren't there in \nMozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want \nsome of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go \ndownload them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat \nwill we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.\n\n\n"}
