It's an observation\nnot a judgement, comment, approval.  You've focused on the\nword \"muddy\" to use it in a different context than the one\nI posted.\n\nMaybe the distinction I was trying to make was too subtle and\nI was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning.\nLet me summarize the important parts of my post for you: I\nhave a premise that there is a difference between free and protected\nspeech and action.
