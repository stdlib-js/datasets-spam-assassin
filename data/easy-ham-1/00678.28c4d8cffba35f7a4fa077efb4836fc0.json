Introduced by Sen. Ron\nWyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act\nwould create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill is\nco-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).\n\nThe proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would\nsupport long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective\neducation and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers\nand professionals.\n\n\"The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big step\nforward for this very small technology,\" Lieberman, who vowed to pushed to\nfull Senate passage before the end of the year, said. \"Nowhere in the world\nare the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of\nnanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to\nlead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will provide\nthe nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate\nnew collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will\nensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation.\"\n\nThe bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology\nprogram under the National Science and Technology Council. It would also\ncreate a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and National\nNanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative and\ntechnical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council.\n\n\"My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to\nchange America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer\nrevolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will\nmine the opportunities of nanotechnology,\" Wyden said in introducing the\nbill. \"At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a\nhalf-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its various\nnanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leader\nin this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential to\nachieving that goal.\n\nTo study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center for\nSocietal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related to\nNanotechnology would also be established.\n\nAccording to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the\nNational Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of the\nNational Nanotechnology Initiative in June.\n\nThose recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;\nemphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and\nshort-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,\nequipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research\nthat falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting\ninterdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology\ntransition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal\nimplications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,\neducational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for\nmeasuring progress toward program goals.\n\n\n\n"}
