I have an excellent ESS Maestro3 which OSS\nsupports pretty lame so I was forced to learn about ALSA.\n\nI have used these commands to explore ALSA and my chip:\n\narecord -l   (list devices)\narecord -L   (list PCM decices)\n\nI get some output like this:\n\n> arecord -l\ncard 0: MAESTRO3 [ESS Allegro PCI], device 0: Allegro [Allegro]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\n> arecord -L\nPCM list:\n (SNIP - craploads of output)\n\nI noticed that the output from this commands kind of maps to what the alsamixer or\ngamix have.\n\nFor what it is worth, here is what I have in modules.conf for my sound stuff:\n\n> ## ALSA portion\n> alias char-major-116 snd\n> ## OSS/Free portion\n> alias char-major-14 soundcore\n>\n> ## ALSA portion\n> alias snd-card-0 snd-maestro3\n> ## OSS/Free portion\n> alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0\n>\n> ## OSS/Free portion - card #1\n> alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss\n> # BAD alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss\n> alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss\n> # BAD alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss\n> alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss\n> #\n> ## ALSA Options (optional)\n> options snd snd_major=116 snd_cards_limit=1 snd_device_mode=0666\n> options snd-maestro3 snd_index=0 snd_id=MAESTRO3 snd_amp_gpio=8\n> #\n> ## OSS Options (optional)\n> alias snd-card-1 off\n> alias snd-card-2 off\n> alias snd-card-3 off\n> alias sound-slot-1 off\n> alias sound-service-1-0 off\n>\n> ## Preserve Mixer Settings\n> #post-install /usr/sbin/alsactl restore MAESTRO3\n> #pre-remove /usr/sbin/alsactl store MAESTRO3\n> post-install /usr/sbin/alsactl restore\n> pre-remove /usr/sbin/alsactl store\n\nHope that helps, good luck.\n\n\nLance (lance_tt@bellsouth.net) wrote*:\n>\n>Hello,\n>\n>Thanks for these rpms, I removed the binary built from source (.tar.gz)\n>and installed your SRPM of gamix.
