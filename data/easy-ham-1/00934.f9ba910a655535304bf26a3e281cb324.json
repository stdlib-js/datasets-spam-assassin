Unlike competing solutions that \n> process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes \n> the data in \n> hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater \n> performance, \n> according to company officials.\n> \n> The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the \n> first in a \n> family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based \n> startup. The \n> DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \n> called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \n> data.\n> \n> According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \n> conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \n> proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data \n> between two \n> businesses.\n> \n> \"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \n> \"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\n> \n> Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the \n> file size up \n> to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \n> application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \n> alternative.\n> \n> In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \n> importance in the world of XML.\n> \n> \"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \n> said. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \n> Firewalls are blind to XML today.\"\n> \n> Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \n> security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n> \n> According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \n> processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach \n> the company \n> itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with \n> regards to speed \n> and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \n> creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n> \n> \"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \n> adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly \n> said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \n> technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that \n> he believes \n> will be mostly false.\n> Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \n> accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes \n> of a packet, \n> while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at \n> 1,400 bytes \n> and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n> \n> The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large \n> collection of \n> XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the \n> markup language \n> as they pass through the device.\n> \n> The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \n> balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and \n> will identify \n> and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n> \n> In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an \n> application \n> co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators \n> more granular \n> control over what data is inspected and the application server itself \n> controls the device.\n> \n> DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging \n> market. Startup \n> Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega \n> XPE switch in \n> May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, \n> launched with a \n> focus on content processing and acceleration.\n> The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at \n> $54,995. The \n> company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \n> field trails at a number of other enterprises.\n> \n> ==============================================================\n> ===========\n> \n> DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs \n> since it was \n> founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \n> foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \n> would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry \n> interest in XML \n> grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \n> designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique \n> requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was \n> a software \n> interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML \n> processing \n> is still licensed by many companies for use in their own \n> products today.\n> \n> Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \n> developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team \n> raised the bar \n> and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built \n> hardware. In \n> 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3�), the \n> industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\n> \n> Today, XG3� technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML \n> network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \n> Services. While other companies are just now marketing first \n> versions of \n> products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, \n> providing an immediate return on technology investments to \n> industry-leading customers and partners.\n> \n> DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that \n> brings decades of experience in the networking and computing \n> industries, \n> drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including \n> Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.\n> \n> ==============================================================\n> ===========\n> \n> DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding\n> \n> Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital \n> Back Pioneer \n> in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services\n> \n> CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the \n> leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced \n> that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing.
