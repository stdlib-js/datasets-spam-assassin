Too many \nkids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be \ninfluenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I \nlearned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are \ntwo different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She's got her \nown place now, and still doesn't have one.  YaY!  Another thing that's \nwrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of \nindividuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending \non the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I've seen Xi \ncome home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something \nthat happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It's a \nbig problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer.  I like the idea of \nthe voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more \nefficiently for how their kids are taught.\n\n \n>   > > > At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and\n> > > counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing\n> > > something wrong.\n> > > \n> > > Maybe we should really go dirty Tleilaxu all the way.\n> > > \n> > \n> > Maybe y'all should buy m-w some more bandwidth.\n> \n> m-w?\n> \nmerriam-webster.
