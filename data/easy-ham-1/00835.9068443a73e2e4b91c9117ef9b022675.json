Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.\n> DINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on\n> their hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in\n> Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked\n> together and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid\n> derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.\n> The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities\n> with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a\n> description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see\n> them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but\n> not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth\n> even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a\n> renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.\n> The definitive work on dragons is \"The Flight of Dragons\" by Peter\n> Dickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long\n> bow. Targets do not come much bigger.\n> \n> Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is that\n> there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard\n> their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They\n> survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.\n> They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet\n> (for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves\n> but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.\n> \n> Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the\n> dinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also\n> to appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote\n> viewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are\n> contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be\n> encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and\n> mind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help\n> so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great\n> difficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should remove\n> all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of\n> Satanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus\n> if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of\n> all other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their\n> psi.\n> \n> THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to\n> hold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.\n> \n> Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of\n> rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young\n> hatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made\n> them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to\n> keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this\n> they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an\n> act of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the\n> ability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and\n> so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have\n> become the source of all Satans, devils and demons.\n> \n> Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep\n> them warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and\n> only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend\n> to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is\n> primarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not\n> suitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.\n> Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,\n> even if they are standing on ice.\n> \n> Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act\n> of love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female\n> can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird\n> sitting on a nest.\n> \n> Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,\n> while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate\n> all enemies of their young, but this is secondary.\n> \n> If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then\n> purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our\n> religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,\n> regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to\n> concentrate on \"How to Brainwash your Neighbour\". Conscious thought has\n> built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using\n> \"How to care for and protect one's young\" as a foundation.\n> \n> Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something \"A load of\n> dinosaur's eggs\". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity\n> tends to purge all malice back to its roots.\n> \n> It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,\n> aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on\n> vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the\n> serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.\n> \n> ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take\n> control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for the\n> following.\n> \n> Nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.\n> Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing\n> hormones, abilities, etc.\n> Mind machines.\n> The original engraving or engram.\n> GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T\n> hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the\n> first job holders.\n> TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of\n> time.\n> \n> My, our, Man's timetracks, etc.\n> The time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic\n> Subconscious, etc.\n> EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.\n> Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever\n> one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the\n> higher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or\n> other basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.\n> Every extinct race, etc.\n> BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via\n> genetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.\n> Every blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.\n> \n\n\n"}
