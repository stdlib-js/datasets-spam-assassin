Getting hammered for stupid investments is likely\nto result in smarter investments in the future.  Nobody is supposed to\nwin all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence. \n\"A fool and his money are soon parted\" and all that.  It isn't the job\nof the FTC/SEC/IRS/etc to make sure you invest your money wisely (and I\nhave grave doubts that they could even if it was their job). \n\n\n> They \n> finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off \n> hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.\n\n\nSo what?  Nobody is guaranteed employment.  Laying people off is not a\ncrime nor is it immoral.  Companies don't exist to provide employment,\nnor should they.  The closest we have to such a thing in the US is a\nGovernment Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds.\n\n \n> So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?\n\n\nPerhaps it is just a matter of personal preference, but I'd rather not\nlive in a \"feed lot\" society, thank-you-very-much.\n\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\n"}
