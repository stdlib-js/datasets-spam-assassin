You have specified\ntestbuff as \"an array of 1024 pointers to characters\".  That means,\nyou have allocated an array big enough to store 1024 pointers.  On\nmost machines, that's 4 bytes per pointer, which indeed would give you\n4096.\n\nJohn\n\nOn Fri, Nov 22, 2002 at 10:27:53PM +0500, Ali Saifullah Khan wrote:\n> Here is a test done on the return of sizes by sizeof() using pointers.\n> \n> #include <iostream.h>\n> \n> int main(void) {\n>  char *testbuff[1024];\n> \n>  int len = sizeof(testbuff);\n>  cout << len << \"\\n\";\n>  return 0;\n> }\n> \n> c:>debug\\testbuff\n> 4096\n> \n> The output from this is 4096 but infact it should be returning 1024.\n> Apparently, using a pointer has multiplied the value of the original size of\n> the testbuff[] buffer by the size of the \" pointer \" ?\n> \n> char pointers have a size of 4 bytes.....as is shown when output is 4 bytes\n> using \" int len = sizeof((char*)testbuff); \"\n> \n> c:>debug\\testbuff\n> 4\n> \n> so sizeof is returning the size of the \"first\" entity passed to it, that\n> being the size of the pointer. \" * \"\n> \n> Whats confusing is when sizeof outputs the value for something like \" char *\n> testbuff[] \"\n> Here the macro seems to be multiplying the sizes of entities passed to it,\n> by considering the first entity as the pointer denoted by the asterisk\n> itself \" * \", and then taking this value of 4 and multiplying it with the\n> size of the buffer testbuff[] which is 1024, to produce an output of 4096.\n> \n> Rather strange behaviour. ???\n> ----- Original Message -----\n> From: <cdavison@nucleus.com>\n> To: <secprog@securityfocus.com>\n> Cc: <viega@securesoftware.com>\n> Sent: Tuesday, November 19, 2002 2:59 AM\n> Subject: Re: Are bad developer libraries the problem with M$ software?\n> \n> \n> > ----- Original Message -----\n> > From: John Viega\n> > Sent: 11/18/2002 2:28:08 PM\n> > To: cdavison@nucleus.com\n> > Cc: secprog@securityfocus.com\n> > Subject: Re: Are bad developer libraries the problem with M$ software?\n> >\n> > > strlen does not work, because he was trying to get at the ALLOCATED\n> > > size of a buffer, not the actual size of the buffer.\n> >\n> > You're right.
