Did that on my laptop and well.. it was painfull to say the least \n(including a ecovery from totally corrupted rpmdb) Don't expect it to be \nan easy 'dist-upgrade' at any rate, so much stuff has changed and apt \ndoesn't always handle all that well the way dependencies are set in \nRHL.\n\n> \n> Even if it's possible, are there good reasons why maybe I should not do\n> it and just use the RH iso's (I don't think RH8 will upgrade from\n> (null), maybe up2date will)?\n\nIt's possible but not supported by RH. I've upgraded both my laptop and my \nhome box from (null) to RH8.0 and didn't encounter any issues though.\n\n-- \n\t- Panu -\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
