In pratice that would probably work fine.\n\nNote that timtest.py's current tokenizer only looks at decoded text/* MIME\nsections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could put\nmegabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at\n(except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough to\nskip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type,\nDisposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIME\nsections).\n\nSchemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting\narbitrary amounts of \"nice text\" in the preamble area (after the headers and\nbefore the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but\nwhich appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoring\nscheme.\n\nBut I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they\nexist <0.5 wink>.  Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no\nparticular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage for\nspammers in trying to fool just one scheme.  Even if they did, for the kind\nof scheme we're using here they can't *know* what \"nice text\" is, not unless\nthey pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their\nmessages to each different one.  At that point they'd be doing targeted\nmarketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously.\n\nif-you're-out-to-make-a-quick-buck-you-don't-waste-a-second-on-hard-\n    targets-ly y'rs  - tim\n\n"}
