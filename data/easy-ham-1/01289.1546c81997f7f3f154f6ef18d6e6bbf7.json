It's\ngenerally wise to have a special \"build\" environment to avoid these\nhassles. Most likely you have some library loading path in your env. An\nstrace of the app will show it:\n\n\tthe-app 2>&1 | grep dude\n\nPersonally, I have a script called logbuild whose entire purpose is to\nstart a shell with a minimal build environment, logged with script. The\nprevents this kind of error. Since configure yanks all sorts of ill\ndocumented values from one's environment for use in the build (CC, ARCH,\nvarious LD_* variables) this kind of thing is necessary.\n\nOften the easiest thing is to have a special nonroot account with no .profile\nfor building stuff.\n\nCheers,\n-- \nCameron Simpson, DoD#743        cs@zip.com.au    http://www.zip.com.au/~cs/\n\nDo not taunt Happy Fun Coder.\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n"}
