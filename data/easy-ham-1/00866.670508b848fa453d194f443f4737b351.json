Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All\n\nOctober 2, 2002\nBy LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN \n\n\n\n\n \n\nApparently it fell into the category \"too good to check.\"\n\n\nLast Friday, several British newspapers reported that the\nWorld Health Organization had found in a study that blonds\nwould become extinct within 200 years, because blondness\nwas caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The\nreports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News\nprogram \"Good Morning America,\" and on Saturday by CNN. \n\nThere was only one problem, the health organization said in\na statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds\nwould become extinct, and it had never done a study on the\nsubject. \n\n\"W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports\noriginated,\" said the organization, an agency of the United\nNations based in Geneva, \"but would like to stress that we\nhave no opinion of the future existence of blonds.\" \n\nAll the news reports, in Britain and the United States,\ncited a study from the World Health Organization - \"a\nblonde-shell study,\" as The Daily Star of London put it.\nBut none reported any scientific details from the study or\nthe names of the scientists who conducted it. \n\nOn \"Good Morning America,\" Charles Gibson began a\nconversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:\n\"There's a study from the World Health Organization, this\nis for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women\nand men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural\nblonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth\nwithin 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as\nbrunets.\" \n\nMs. Sawyer said she was \"somewhat of a natural blonde.\"\n\n\nJeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the\nanchors got the information from an ABC producer in London\nwho said he had read it in a British newspaper. \n\nIn London, The Sun and The Express both reported that\nunnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in\nScandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected\nthe last true blond to hail from Finland. \n\nThe British accounts were replete with the views of\nbleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow\nblondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare\ngenes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an\nendangered species. \n\nJournalists in London said last night that the source of\nthe reports was probably one of several European news\nagencies that are used by the British press, but it\nremained unclear which one. \n\nTim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the\nreport was probably distributed by The Press Association,\nBritain's domestic news agency. \"Several papers picked it\nup,\" he said. \n\nBut Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press\nAssociation, said that although it had considered running\nthe report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking\nto the World Health Organization. \n\n\"We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the\nWorld Health Organization first,\" she said. \"They told us\nthat report was two years old, and had been covered at the\ntime. They said it had been picked up again that day by a\nGerman news agency.\" \n\nShe added that she did not know which agency the\norganization was referring to. \n\nDr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California\nat San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for\nblond hair \"sounds patently incorrect.\"\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/health/02BLON.html?ex=1034599071&ei=1&en=3a0e4f0b2b251593\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n\n\n"}
