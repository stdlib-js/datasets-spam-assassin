There are an awful lot of \n    them here, and the ones I looked at were surprizingly readable. I was \n    looking for the Balfour Declaration, the thing I saw cited as the start of \n    Israel recently. Suprizingly this document is only four paragraphs. The \n    Oslo Accords (Israel/PLO agreement of 1993) is another thing much shorter \n    than I had imagined.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Eli!_)\n\n[1] http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/avalon.htm\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/bYTBfpCnesw\n\n\n"}
