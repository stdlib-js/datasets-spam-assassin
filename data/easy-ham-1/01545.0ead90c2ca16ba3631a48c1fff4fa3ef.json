These messages could end up being falsely (or incorrectly) reported\n   to Razor, DCC, Pyzor, etc.  Certain RBLs too.  I don't think the\n   results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way,\n   shape, or form when running over a public corpus.\n\n2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects\n   like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA\n   tuning and development.\n\n3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off\n   filters.  And, of course, there's always progression in technology\n   (by both spammers and non-spammers).\n\nThe second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa\nsignature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used\nby SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or\nSHA-1 of each file).\n\nThe third problem doesn't really worry me.\n\nThese problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique\nto spam filtering.  Compression corpuses and other performance-related\ncorpuses have their own set of problems, of course.\n\nIn other words, I don't think there's any replacement for having\nmultiple independent corpuses.  Finding better ways to distribute\ntesting and collate results seems like a more viable long-term solution\n(and I'm glad we're working on exactly that for SpamAssassin).  If\nyou're going to seriously work on filter development, building a corpus\nof 10000-50000 messages (half spam/half non-spam) is not really that\nmuch work.  If you don't get enough spam, creating multi-technique\nspamtraps (web, usenet, replying to spam) is pretty easy.  And who\ndoesn't get thousands of non-spam every week?  ;-)\n\nDan\n\n\n"}
