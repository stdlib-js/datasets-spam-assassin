He expects to break his record next year \ntopping his 13.1sec/99mph run a couple of years ago. He's shooting for a \n12 second run.\n\nJohn also took out a replica 1908 Oldsmobile for a respectable 47mph \nrun. (Remember, we started out with electric cars.)\n\nNear the end of the day, Kilacycle took the track with an amazing 111mph \nrun. Talk about a crotch rocket.\n\n...Ross...\n\n\nOn Saturday, August 31, 2002, at 01:45  AM, Adam L.
