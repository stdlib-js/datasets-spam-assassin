This means that you can \ninsert your own non-sucky subtitles, make and circulate edit-lists that make \nhighlight reels for your favorite movies, etc, etc. It all amounts to a sweet \ntool for making the audience into the _former audience_, participants in \nentertainment. Of course, it's also illegal under the DMCA, since the tool also \nnecessarily circumvents the copy-prevention in pre-recorded DVDs to accomplish \nits ends.
