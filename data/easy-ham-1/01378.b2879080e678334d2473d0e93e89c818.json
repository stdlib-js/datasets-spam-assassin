Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant\npyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the\nvast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, I\ncan't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers\ndown when it's never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of\nthe business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of\nthe ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for\nthe whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes,\nthese people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they're not\nsecret agents.  They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole\nbusiness is about finding them and putting them out of business\n\nHabeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark)\nin a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business\nplan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with \"not spam\", I can't\nunderstand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be\nunsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the\npotential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the\nHabeas warrant mark.\n\nDaniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on\nyour installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only\nlicense the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on\nthe HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove\nus from the next release.  But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it\nhas a chance to show any promise.\n\nAt the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it\nencourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those\nwithout SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the\ntransmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't\nsteal any more cars.  But only if we're given a chance to succeed.\n\n          - dan\n--\nDan Kohn <mailto:dan@dankohn.com>\n<http://www.dankohn.com/>  <tel:+1-650-327-2600> \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Daniel Quinlan [mailto:quinlan@pathname.com] \nSent: Wednesday, August 28, 2002 16:38\nTo: Matthew Cline\nCc: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net\nSubject: Re: [SAtalk] O.T.

Between now and conclusion of the first court\n   case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes!\n\n - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen\n   cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc.\n\n - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I\n   don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,\n   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,\n   \"pump and dump\" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly\n   required for the spammer to get their way.\n\nDan\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing \nreal-time communications platform!
