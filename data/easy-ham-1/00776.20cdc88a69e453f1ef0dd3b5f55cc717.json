They visited a lot of airshows and covered a lot of\nmiles.  I'm sure maintenance (on a 50+ year old airframe), fuel (for two\nlarge radial engines) insurance and other costs were out of my price\nrange, but what a hoot!\n\n    On a more realistic note, the flight to Half Moon bay was probably 2\nhours of flight time at about  $75/hour in the Cessna.  Not exactly a\ncheap date, but that's nothing compared to the money I've spent on her\nsince.  (And loved every minute of it, Darling!!)\n\n        <Somebody>\n\n\n\"R. A.
