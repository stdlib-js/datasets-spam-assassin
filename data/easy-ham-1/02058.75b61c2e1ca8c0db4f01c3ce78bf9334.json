I wonder if \nI'll ever have $250 to spend on fonts. *Update:* Kevin Marks[1], who is \nstupendously incredible for far more things than I can list here points out \nthat it's _included with OS X_. I knew Mac OS X included a lot of grat fonts[2]\n, but I don't know how I overlooked this. (Matthew Carter, I'd be happy to pay \nyou the two cents in royalties you probably get for selling $100 worth of \nfonts.) \n\nTufte notes: Terrie Miller[3]. \n\nFirst ammendement beer bash. \n\niSync Beta[4] (guess they learned a lesson from iCal) is out.\n\n\n\n[1] http://epeus.blogspot.com\n[2] http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/font.html\n[3] http://www.oreillynet.com/~terrie/tufte/\n[4] http://www.apple.com/isync/\n\n\n"}
