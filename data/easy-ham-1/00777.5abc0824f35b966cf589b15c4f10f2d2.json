Can I get a playlist?\n> A. We are unable to offer a playlist. The Digital Performance Right in \n> Sound Recordings Act of 1995 passed by Congress prevents us from \n> disclosing such information. The Digital Law states that if one is \n> transmitting a digital signal, song information cannot be \n> pre-announced. It is a Music Choice policy not to release a playlist of \n> upcoming or previously played songs.\n\nRecently, MusicChoice upgraded their website with a very important \nservice, as far as I'm concerned: real-time song info from their \nwebsite. My DirecTV receiver is up on a shelf (and its display scrolls \nintermittently); and I'm surely not going to fire up my projector while \nlistening to the \"radio\", so I'm quite happy that I can retrieve r/t \nsong info with URLs like:\n\nhttp://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/soundsoftheseasons.asp\nhttp://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/rap.asp\nhttp://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/opera.asp\netc...\n\nNow, if I were a more eager hacker, I'd write up little WSDL stubs for \nthese event streams (they're clearly not worried about load, since their \nown web pages specify 15 sec meta-refresh) and then feed 'em through a \ncontent router to alert me to cool songs. Heck, cross-reference the \nservice to CDDB and... :-)\n\nRK\n\n\n"}
