HR is not\nbeing honest with you so there's no ethical quandry to be totally\nhonest with them: If they want experience numbers that would place you\nin the OAK project, lead them to believe that you have \"something\nroughly equivalent\" (ie \"it wasn't 5 years, but it was three intense\nyears with plenty of overtime\") -- they are playing a bluff in saying\n/they/ know the job requirements so you're perfectly within poker\nrules to bluff back to say you have it.\n\nIf you /don't/ have the requisite Right Stuff, the engineers can\nusually suss it out pretty fast during the second interview.  Most\noften, their choice is based 90% on \"who can I work with\" and only\nmaybe 10% on \"how much/little will we have to tutor this candidate?\"\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\n Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com\n\"Computers are useless.
