I think that decentralization is the workaround\nfrom technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only way\ninconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by \nprotecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. \nThe local information when combined with the technical\ntroubles of providing \"just enough\" forced synchronization\nto remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.\nenforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when\nconcerns are more immedidate.  \n\nTolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how\npeople cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily\npre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neck\nwho thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the\nwhole world would be a little more perfect and everything,\nincluding his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistently\nbe in its proper place.\n\nGreg\n\n\n"}
