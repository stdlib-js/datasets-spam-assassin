Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not \nexactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.\n\nJust try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) \nCanada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own \n\"Permit Rajs\" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more \nsocialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).\n\nYet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as \nwell as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the \nexecutives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment \ncommunity for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They \nfinished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off \nhundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.\n\nSo.. tell me again.. how are we better off?\n\n-Ian.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, August 20, 2002, at 12:09 PM, John Hall wrote:\n\n> The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails\n> Everywhere Else -- by Hernando De Soto\t\n>\n> Is something I'm reading now.\n>\n> My impression is that France is not anywhere near the \"Permit Raj\"\n> nightmare that India is (and became).
