OS \nX normally disables screen-capture while the DVD player is running (even if it \nisn't visible!). I have some home movies on DVD that I'd love to get stills \nfrom, but I can't -- the DVD licensing board has forced Apple to break my \nhardware in such a way as to prevent me from doing something completely lawful, \nto make sure that I never, ever grab a frame out of _Police Academy n - 1_. \nNice to see that independent software authors are willing to un-break my gear \nfor me.
