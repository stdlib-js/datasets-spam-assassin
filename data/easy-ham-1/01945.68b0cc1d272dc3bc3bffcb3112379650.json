I'll be back in a couple of \ndays with the answers.\n\n\n-  Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away? \n\n-  Any fool can get into college. Only a select few can say the same about \nAmanda Jones.\n\n-  My dear, since Eve picked the apple, no woman has ever been taken entirely \nunawares.\n\n-  This is Tommy. He tells people he's named after a gun, but I know he's named \nafter a famous 19th century ballerina.\n\n-  When one woman strikes at the heart of another she seldom misses, and the \nwound is invariably fatal.\n\n-  I've never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. With my \ndress off, it's _most_ unusual.\n\n-  You're nothing to me now. You're not a brother, you're not a friend. I don't \nwant to know you or what you do. I don't want to see you at the hotels, I don't \nwant you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know a day in \nadvance, so I won't be there.\n\n-  Kids: 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.\n\n-  Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.\n\n-  A hundred million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet \nsmaller than my sister.\n\n-  Mother, I do not need a blind date. Particularly not with some verbally \nincontinent spinster who drinks like a fish, smokes like a chimney and dresses \nlike her mother.\n\n-  Have you ever seen a body like this before in your life?\nShe happens to be my daughter.\nOh. Then I guess you have.\n\n-  I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.\n\n-  Of course, you won't be able to lie on your back for a while but then you \ncan lie from any position, can't you?\n\n-  The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that \nit was going to happen.\n\n-  Women need a reason for having sex. Men just need a place.\n\n-  You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are \nthe same decaying organic matter as everything else.\n\n-  Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue! \n\n-  The issue is not whether you are paranoid. Look around you Lenny. The issue \nis whether you are paranoid enough.\n\n-  Inconceivable!\nYou keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. \n\nEnjoy.\n\n\n"}
