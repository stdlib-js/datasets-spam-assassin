This feeling seems especially intense in the Bush\nAdministration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by a\nfather-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believe\nthat, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family has\nresumed its governance-and about time, too.\n\nThe Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, or\nworse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.\nRepublicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense and\nforeign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as\nClinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.\nCondoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article in\nForeign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clinton\nof \"an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the\ncommander in chief.\" Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this\nAdministration also served under the President's father. They took office\nlast year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswatting\nby Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off.\n\nNot long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administration\nforeign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the Oval\nRoom. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whose\ncover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of the\nworld, and these words:\n\nDefense Strategy for the 1990s:\nThe Regional Defense Strategy\nSecretary of Defense\nDick Cheney\nJanuary 1993\n\nOne of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is\ncommunicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even elected\npoliticians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then perform\npublicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense\nare just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,\nand are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is go\nto meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, to\nexplain that some of the documents, including the report that the senior\nofficial handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from a\nhigh-school term paper, represent the government version of playing\nCarnegie Hall?\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary of\nDefense, set up a \"shop,\" as they say, to think about American foreign\npolicy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whose\nexistence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, at\na higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of\nDefense; Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a senior\nforeign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group of\nconservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, and\nintellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (Donald\nRumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and has\nbeen closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) Colin\nPowell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted a\ncompeting, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine\nAmerican foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on which\neach team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief President\nBush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling the\nnew grand strategy.\n\nEverybody worked for months on the \"five-twenty-one brief,\" with a sense\nthat the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz and\nPowell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, but\nhis briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,\nperhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn't\nget to present his alternate version of the future of the United States in\nthe world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,\nusing material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his major\nforeign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day that\nIraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.\n\nThe team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of the\nmaterial, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagon\nenvisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, prevent\nany other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks of\ncontroversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks being\n\"unilateral\"-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denials\nand the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.\n\nAs it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheney\nteam's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that the\nsenior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before\nClinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a \"scrubbed,\"\nmeaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained the\nessential ideas of \"shaping,\" rather than reacting to, the rest of the\nworld, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one of\nskepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of the\nsame ideas can be found in a short book titled \"From Containment to Global\nLeadership?,\" which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 and\nis now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into the\nClinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends that\nthe United States \"preclude the rise of another global rival for the\nindefinite future.\" Khalilzad writes, \"It is a vital U.S. interest to\npreclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessary\nfor the purpose.\"\n\nWhen George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people around\nhim didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of\nthe policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence which\nthe United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first major\nforeign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that \"a\nPresident must be a clear-eyed realist,\" a formulation that seems to\nconnote an absence of world-remaking ambition. \"Realism\" is exactly the\nforeign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partly\nbecause it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominating\nworld affairs for any length of time.\n\nOne gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terrorist\nattacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.\nAny chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bush\nhas done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domestic\nsecurity. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly\nentering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are that\nBush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,\naggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change in\ndirection rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,\nespecially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congress\nsince September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which\nhis aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment of\ndestiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,\nbecause it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertive\npolicymaking.\n\nInside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been \"a\ntransformative moment,\" as the senior official I had lunch with put it, is\nnot so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials\nhad previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the American\npublic's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, at\nleast for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the \"Black\nHawk Down\" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the\nconviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombing\nKosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreign\nmilitary adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, the\noptions are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999\nstudy of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,\nwhich argued that the \"mass public\" is much less casualty-averse than the\nmilitary or the civilian �lite believes; for example, the study showed that\nthe public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to\nprevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The American\ndeath total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September\n11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.\n\nRecently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice's\nForeign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: \"The United\nStates has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest'\nin the absence of Soviet power.\" I asked her whether that is still the\ncase. \"I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role,\" she said\nimmediately. \"I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakes\nthat clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief.\" Like Bush,\nshe said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons\nof mass destruction \"in the hands of irresponsible states\" now define the\nnational interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech to\nCongress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was ending\nterrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face the\npart of the White House grounds where television reporters do their\nstandups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she does\nin public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind of\nmissionary calm, rather than belligerence.\n\nIn the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist,\nputting forth \"the notions of power politics, great powers, and power\nbalances\" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now she\nsounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney's\nPentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that the\nother great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because of\nthe terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. \"Theoretically, the\nrealists would predict that when you have a great power like the United\nStates it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to\nchallenge it or trying to balance against it,\" Rice said. \"And I think what\nyou're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move to\nproductive and co�perative relations with the United States, rather than to\ntry to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft matters\nin how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained.\"\n\nRice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the\nNational Security Council and asked them to think seriously about \"how do\nyou capitalize on these opportunities\" to fundamentally change American\ndoctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. \"I\nreally think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947,\" she said-that is,\nthe period when the containment doctrine took shape-\"in that the events so\nclearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a big\nglobal threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally\nthought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting the\ntectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try to\nseize on that and position American interests and institutions and all of\nthat before they harden again.\"\n\nThe National Security Council is legally required to produce an annual\ndocument called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goals\nof American policy-another government report whose importance is great but\nnot obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as the\nClinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she is\nworking on the report now.\n\n\"There are two ways to handle this document,\" she told me. \"One is to do it\nin a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that,\nsince this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it's\nimportant. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, prior\nto 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but I\nwould think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a real\nstatement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic direction\nthat it's going.\"\n\nIt seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant\nAmerican role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Some\nquestions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously being\nasked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone in\nforeign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engender\ninside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak a\ncouple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensive\ncapability against \"rogue states,\" departed from decades of official\nadherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication of\nthe scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States now\nin a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East,\nand replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the Bush\nAdministration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly it\nis, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few\nmonths ago.\n\nJust before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggested\nto me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction in\nforeign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz or\nRichard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration,\nand an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, he\npublished a book titled \"The Reluctant Sheriff,\" in which he poked a little\nfun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (he\ncalled it the \"Pentagon Paper\") and disagreed with its idea that the United\nStates should try to be the world's only great power over the long term.\n\"For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach,\" Haass wrote. \"It\nsimply is not doable.\" Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another of\nthe Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding the\n\"democratic zone of peace\": \"Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony.\nThe United States cannot compel others to become more democratic.\" Haass\nargued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, not\nmore, and suggested \"a revival of what might be called traditional\ngreat-power politics.\"\n\nWolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary of\nDefense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department-\nin effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in his\noffice at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was an\narray of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff,\nbeginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine and\nthe first holder of the office that Haass now occupies.\n\nIt's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington that\nHaass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book.\n\"Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreign\npolicy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case\nto make,\" he said. \"It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's the\neconomy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are very\ndifferent now. One, the President has a much easier time making the case\nthat foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-security\ncharts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.\"\n\nI asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as\nKennan's containment. \"I think there is,\" he said. \"What you're seeing from\nthis Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of\nideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call the\nlimits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not to\nmassacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.\nIf a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some of\nthe normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left alone\ninside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States,\ngain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even lead\nto a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially can\nact in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when,\nand not if, you're going to be attacked.\"\n\nClearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. \"I don't think the American public\nneeds a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein,\" he said.\n\"Also, I'd fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make the\ncase. Public opinion can be changed. We'd be able to make the case that\nthis isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense.\"\n\nOn the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was still\nmaintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not long\nbefore called \"Imperial America,\" but he told me that there is a big\ndifference between imperial and imperialist. \"I just think that we have to\nbe a little bit careful,\" he said. \"Great as our advantages are, there are\nstill limits. We have to have allies. We can't impose our ideas on\neveryone. We don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others to\njoin us. American leadership, yes; but not American unilateralism. It has\nto be multilateral. We can't win the war against terror alone. We can't\nsend forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor.\"\n\nHe stopped for a moment. \"Is there a successor idea to containment? I think\nthere is,\" he said. \"It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S.\nforeign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to\ncertain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition to\nterrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade,\ndemocracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policies\nand then building institutions that lock them in even more.\"\n\nThe first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a new\nAmerican foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. What\nthe United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what's\nbeen done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of the\noperation itself and in terms of its aftermath.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress,\nthe Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage of\nhis aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask,\nevidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public event\nwas a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi's\nleading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and former\nDefense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremely\nconfident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, \"Evidence is mounting\nthat the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing\nwith Saddam Hussein.\" The war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete\n\"until Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing his\nregime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt.\"\n\nChalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with a\ntwinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suit\nand a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and his\nsupporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient American\nsupport, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated the\nTaliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people in\nWashington. It isn't just that Chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebel\nmilitary leader (\"He could fight you for the last petit four on the tray\nover tea at the Savoy, but that's about it,\" one skeptical former Pentagon\nofficial told me), or that he isn't in Iraq. It's also that Saddam's\nmilitary is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban's was, and has been\nquite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The United\nStates left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to an\ninternal rebellion; Chalabi's supporters believe that Saddam is much weaker\nnow, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could\nfinish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the idea\nthat a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment of\nanywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American ground\ntroops.\n\nKenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National Security\nCouncil's staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the Clinton\nAdministration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world by\npublishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam.\nThis was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authors\npublished an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the Iraqi\nNational Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn't\nthink Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require a\nsubstantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the one\nwe used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now in\nAfghanistan.\n\nPollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given a\nbriefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office in\nWashington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and\nwalked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East were\nhanging. \"The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion,\" he said, using a\npen as a pointer. \"We're talking about two grand corps, two to three\nhundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in the\nTigris-Euphrates valley.\" He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra.\n\"Ideally, you'd have the Saudis on board.\" He pointed to the Prince Sultan\nairbase, near Riyadh. \"You could make Kuwait the base, but it's much easier\nin Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq\"-pointing\nagain-\"because otherwise they'll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oil\nfields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oil\nfields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend the\nKurds in northern Iraq.\" Point, point. \"You go in as hard as you can, as\nfast as you can.\" He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. \"You get the\nenemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once.\" His\nhand hit the desk again, hard. \"Then you crush him.\" Smack.\n\nThat would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removed\nthe government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviously\nshaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan,\nwhich before September 11th clearly met the new test of national\nunacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass\ndestruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country is\nnot wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of Daniel\nPearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligence\nservice, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq,\nif America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must be\nestablished-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is no\nobvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawn\nstrong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is a\nnuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internal\naffairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, Saudi\nArabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to become\ndirectly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wanted\nto do. So it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the way\nthat Europe was immediately after the Second World War.\n\nIn September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz's recommendation of immediate\nmoves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is an\nindication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration's\nconservatives. \"These guys are relentless,\" one former official, who is\nclose to the high command at the State Department, told me. \"Resistance is\nfutile.\" The conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, is\nintellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and since\nSeptember 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least\nthe beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptance\npractically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies the\ndoctrines of Cheney's old Pentagon team, \"shaping\" and expanding \"the zone\nof democracy,\" the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.\n\nThe outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility with\nthe Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami,\nof the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whom\nsee the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewis\nwas invited to the White House in December to brief the senior\nforeign-policy staff. \"One point he made is, Look, in that part of the\nworld, nothing matters more than resolute will and force,\" the senior\nofficial I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn't\nproceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the \"Arab street,\" as long as it is\nprepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interesting\nthinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essay\ndeclared, \"Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,\"\nand Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who published\nan article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime in\nIran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could be\naccomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)\n\nSeveral people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of the\nnations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on,\nif they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going to\nfinish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney's recent diplomatic\ntour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamely\nabsorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, the\nAdministration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of\nthe world's approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that the\nUnited States should assemble \"coalitions of the willing\" to support its\nactions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure\nof international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would test\nthat policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting that\nit can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publicly\nopposed the Iraq operation.\n\nWhen the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it asked\nfor a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal\n2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improve\nmilitary pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated as\nan unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on\nterrorism. That's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of\nIraq.\n\nThis spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries about\nthe invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bush\nbuilds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the\nunacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A drama\ninvolving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the spring\nand summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the terms\nthat Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions,\nare unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, the\nenormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. The\nAdministration obviously feels confident that the United States can\neffectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troop\nbuildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause the\nRepublican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddam\nand topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to a\nfull-scale American invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently will\nbegin soon.\n\nLewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney's\nfuture-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, now\nworks in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking the\nWest Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet of\npublic-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of\nhis 1996 novel, \"The Apprentice,\" quotes the Times' calling him \"Dick\nCheney's Dick Cheney,\" which seems like an apt description: he appears\nabsolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result of\nthe influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravelly\nrumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression of\nhaving calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction\nwhich the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for\nthose charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the only\ntruly prudent course.\n\nWhen I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, before\nSeptember 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have been\ndifferent. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder,\nfilled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the Middle\nEast. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer.\n\n\"Let us stack it up,\" he said at last. \"Somalia, 1993; 1994, the discovery\nof the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines; 1993, the World Trade\nCenter, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush,\nformer President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of a\nserious response to that; 1995, the Riyadh bombing; 1996, the Khobar\nbombing; 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassy\nbombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing of\nthe Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis,\nand eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and the\nfailure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas.\nNo one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take that\nlong list and you ask, 'Did we respond in a way which discouraged people\nfrom supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against our\ninterests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged\nfurther aggressions against U.S. interests?,' many observers conclude no,\nand ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to rise\nup and say credibly, 'The Americans don't have the stomach to defend\nthemselves. They won't take casualties to defend their interests. They are\nmorally weak.' \"\n\nLibby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not been\nstandard or foreordained. \"Look at what the President has done in\nAfghanistan,\" he said, \"and look at his speech to the joint session of\nCongress\"-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. \"He made it\nclear that it's an important area. He made it clear that we believe in\nexpanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world.\nHe made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. And\nhe had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and to\nbegin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is\nnot a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example.\nThere are many other courses that the President could have taken. He could\nhave waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engaged\nin long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a new\nrelationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been so\nafraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn't seek its help. This list could\ngo on to twice or three times the length I've mentioned so far. But,\ninstead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations while\nstanding up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don't know\nyet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations not\nonly with Afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with the\nstates of Central Asia, Pakistan, Russia, and, as it may develop, with the\nstates of Southwest Asia more generally.\"\n\nWe moved on to Iraq, and the question of what makes Saddam Hussein\nunacceptable, in the Administration's eyes. \"The issue is not inspections,\"\nLibby said. \"The issue is the Iraqis' promise not to have weapons of mass\ndestruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of Kuwait, their\npromise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they made\nin '91, and a number of U.N. resolutions, including all the other problems\nI listed. Whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-Iraq\nwas given a second chance to abide by international norms. It failed to\ntake that chance then, and annually for the next ten years.\"\n\n\"What's your level of confidence,\" I asked him, \"that the current regime\nwill, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?\"\n\nHe ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke\nslowly and deliberately. \"There is no basis in Iraq's past behavior to have\nconfidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior.\"\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
