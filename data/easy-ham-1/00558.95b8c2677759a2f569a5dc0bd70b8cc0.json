Those who deny such a watershed event take a\nsuperficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply\nbecause the sun still rises and sets.\n\nThis is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing\ninto the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans � all seen live in real\ntime by millions the world over � tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,\nwhich, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers\ndealt in icons � the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the\nmanifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and\ncentering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,\nthey got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing\nhas instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.\n\nIslamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally\nrepugnant � and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By\nlurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the\nvampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and\nbombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only\nghoulish not fearsome.\n\nThe more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found\nthem both vile and yet banal � and so is confident and eager to eradicate\nthem and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite\nanother to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily\ndodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good\ntheater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British\ncommandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and\nan occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of\nthe attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,\nbut also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,\nthe plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist\nparadise on earth.\n\nForeign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with\nEurope, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic\nnomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters �\na paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold\nWar. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has\ninsidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an\nantidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power\nis as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often\ndubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally\nexposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the\nmoment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed\nthe problems inherent in \"the European way\" became all too apparent:\npretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract\nmoralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and\nconstant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire\nwhile we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with\nonly a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more\nsobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European\nhobbits after September 11.\n\nAmerica learned that \"moderate\" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile\nIslamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti\nmeans nothing special to an American � at least not proof of being any more\nfriendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.\nIndeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of\ntheir anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases � like NATO � belongs to a\npre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn\nthat broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is\njust as deadly to our interests as scud missiles � and as likely to come\nfrom friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan\noffer more long-term hope than \"stable regimes\" like the Saudis; governments\nthat hate us have populations that like us � and vice versa; the Saudi royal\nfamily, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which\nhas snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic\nreformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic\ngovernments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as\nArab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.\n\nThe post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the\nmilitary brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq \"chicken\nhawks\" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings\nhollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillness\nagainst his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery\nended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.\nMore Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those\nsoldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30\nyears ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of\nVietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no\ngeneration of Americans in the present military � other than a few thousand\nbrave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama � who have been in\nsustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American\nsoldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security\nis lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in\nlower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the\nPentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.\n\nReal concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than\nrejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad\nas our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at\nhome. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into\nharm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect\nthousands in high-rises.\n\nPolitics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical\nconservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes\nrepellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe\nto champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose\nbelly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were\nso often at loggerheads with na�ve and idealist leftists.\n\nNo longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet\nCommunism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions\nof freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise\nopen economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,\neven reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in\nthe Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if\nmulticulturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western\nconstruct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim\nnonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the\nLeft, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and\nidealism � with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president\nastute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.\n\nAll this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the\nsubsequent terrible year � and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we\nwill see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
