The parallel \n    is not without merit. Building web pages the right way is hard at first, \n    but once you get it, you never want to go back. Regardless, we miss OS 9's \n    flexibility and ease of use, and a metric ton of logic doesn't offset that \n    feeling of loss. \n\n\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0902a.html#osxbluesupdate\n\n\n"}
