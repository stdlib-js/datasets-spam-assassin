Unlike \neveryone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for \npermission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a \nbox of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket \nwas suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. \n\n    The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my \n    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. \n\nShe put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They \ntook everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used \nthe opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked \nback up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying \"This can't \ngo on board.\" \"I don't remember packing that,\" I said. I let her confiscate it. \n\nI called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of \nterrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I \ncan't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once \nI'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but \nif they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the \nscissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their \nfists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky \nmouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, \nthey use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they \nuse the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever \nterrorists. \n\n*Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was \nusing to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The \nnation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  \n\n=== Waiting for Wireless === \n\nNow I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while \nbusinessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I \nused last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, \nI had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite \nthe airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, \nyou know)--I doubt they will accept it. \n\n=== Irony === \n\nAccording to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his \nflight. \n\nI think of what I'd say if I ran into him. \"Jack!\" I'd exclaim, as if we were \nold pals. \"Going to the Eldred case?\" Of course he was. \"Going to be a good \none.\" \"Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?\" I'd ask. \"You said \nyou were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the \nInternet. What ever happened to that?\" I imagine him mumbling and looking down \nat his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. \n\nAnother announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing \nthese airline announcements keep me up to date. \n\n=== Automatic Flush Toilets === \n\nNow I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In \nthe first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little \nshort...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle \none mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three \ntimes. \n\nThis is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they \nexpect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied \nimmediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web \nsite. \n\n=== Arrival === \n\nI've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the \nsidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with \nLisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now \nfor the meetings and parties. \n\nSorry for not responding to your email. I'm rather busy. ;-)\n\n\n\n"}
