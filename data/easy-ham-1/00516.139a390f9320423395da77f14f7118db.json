The publicity about the disease was very much the kind where it was easy to say, \"That isn't me. I'm not promiscuous.\" Promiscuity, especially, was a piece where people could easily say, \"Well, I'm not. Promiscuous is more than I do.\" If you have 300 partners a year, you can think you're not promiscuous if you know somebody who has 500. So it's all relative, and it was easy to feel that that isn't me.\"\n\nYou could find hets who have the same kind of partner volume.  BFD.\nThis kind of random generation of numbers that leads the nutty\nreligious bigots (as you mentioned earlier).\n\nGrr.   Bits damnit.  Now, I must go brief.\n\n-BB\n\n\nEL>> On Sun, 8 Sep 2002, CDale wrote:\n\n>>> I agree w/ ya Tom.  That kind of thinking is SO idiotic.
