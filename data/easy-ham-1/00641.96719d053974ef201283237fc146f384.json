My story remains the same, take it \nor leave it. I've said the same words to white supremacists as to \nsuburban leftist punks as to homeys as to French Irish, etc. etc.:\n\nI don't have to agree with anything you say. I *am* obligated to defend \nto the death your right to say it. I don't give a rat's ass where you \nsay it, even in France. I don't care where the political pendulum has \nswung currently.\n\nChuck\n\nOn Tuesday, September 17, 2002, at 10:38 AM, Owen Byrne wrote:\n\n> On Tue, Sep 17, 2002 at 10:19:13AM -0700, Chuck Murcko wrote:\n>> Probably because we have this pesky 1st Amendment thing here.
