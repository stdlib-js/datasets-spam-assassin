That may be true for the first sale, \nbut once something is out in the world, the \"creator\" loses control... If I \nbuy a chair you built, and then decide to give it away to my neighbor, by \nyou're definition, he just stole from you.\n\n>Fair use needs to be clarified a bit and then I hope they start locking\n>people up.

In many places, it's \ncalled \"advertising\": \"buy one, get one free\", \"free shipping on any order \nover $25\", \"buy this couch, and get a coffee table for free\", \"free popcorn \nwith any movie rental\", \"free doorprize to the first 100 people who enter\", \n\"the author will be signing books (for free) at such and such bookstore\".\n\nAccess to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  Just because you \n(and the entertainment industry, it seems) can't be creative enough to come \nup with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't \ntake it out on the rest of us.\n\nMike\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
