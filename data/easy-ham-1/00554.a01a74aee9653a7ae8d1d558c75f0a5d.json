The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: \nhuge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; \nand unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to \nfailure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.\n\nThe MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into \"near-line\" \narchive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive \narchitectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including \nexecutive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be \nrecovered on demand.\n\nThese new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the \nstorage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, \nthese files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced \nstarting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers \nhigh capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between \ntraditional ATA and SCSI drives.\n\nFor system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, \neasy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server \nenvironments.\n\n\"The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies \nare meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, \nfinancial documents and transaction records,\" said Mike Dooley, senior \ndirector of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. \"Users may \nnot need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but \nwhen they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA \ntechnology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our \nlegacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA \nhard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these \nenterprise applications.\"\n\nThe MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for \ncapacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for \ncapacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage \ndensity than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been \ntested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, \nalready exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, \nwhich exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a \nthree-year warranty.\n\nThe MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM \nUltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. \nThe MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation \nserial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum \ndata transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace \nwith the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive \nenvironments and enterprise applications.\n\nWith a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for \nmanaging hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA \nadvances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. \nThe interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn \nallows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with \nincreased design flexibility and hot plug capability.\n\n\"Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that \nhas previously been too expensive to keep on disk,\" said Dave Reinsel, \nanalyst at IDC. \"The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and \nwhen integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling \ncost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have \nbeen the traditional solutions used for near-line applications.\"\n\nAvailability\nLimited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine \nII and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in \nthe fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus \nII with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments \nscheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.\n\nAbout Maxtor\nMaxtor Corporation (www.maxtor.com) is one of the world's leading suppliers \nof information storage solutions.
