You can vote for your favourite by=\n clicking on the image and dialling the number shown beneath.\n\nCalls cost only 10p, or 12 cents from the Republic of Ireland (though it ma=\ny be a bit more if you contact us from other planets).\n\nLines close at 6pm today. We will reveal the\nwinner tomorrow.\n\n\nAliens ... or hoaxers?\nTHE debate continues to rage over the origin of crop circles.\n\nMany believe they are simply the work of human hoaxers � while others are c=\nonvinced they are made by aliens trying to communicate with us.\n\nCrop circle enthusiasts insist that some of the designs appear so quickly a=\nnd on such a vast scale that it is impossible for humans to have made them. =\n\n\nWitnesses even claim to have seen balls of light moving through the fields =\non the nights that circles appear.\n\nResearchers have found connections between some patterns and symbols from a=\nncient religions, mathematics and even music. \n\nCrop circles were first spotted in Britain in the early 1970s and now appea=\nr throughout the world. The weird outlines are still most common in the sout=\nh of England.\n\nTheories about their cause include whirlwinds � known to circle experts as =\nplasma vortexes � earth energies from ley lines or even forces from the huma=\nn mind.\n\nIn the past the circles have also been blamed on mating roe deer, hedgehogs=\n, helicopters and holes in the ozone layer.\n\nRaymond Cox, Chairman of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, said last nigh=\nt: \"It's a great unsolved mystery.\n\n\"We know not all crop circles are created by humans but we cannot say for s=\nure what is making them.\"\n\nPlus lots of photos\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
