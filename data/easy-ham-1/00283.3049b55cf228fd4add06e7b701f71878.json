I get to see bad CDROM problems all the time. Mostly when vendors\nbuy crap cables to try to save $0.02/each, but there are chipsets and\ndrives with known DMA issues as well.\n\n> Normally, even if you try to enable DMA and your device doesn't support it,\n> it simply don't be able to make the change, and that's it.

No\nend_of_the_world problems, and easily fixed.\n\n> I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting\n> the DMA tip in the %description :-)\n\nMy biggest beef with automatically setting /dev/dvd is that I always\nseem to have a CD-Burner and a DVD drive (or DVD burner) in the same\nbox, and I usually have the DVD as the second drive /dev/cdrom1 in\n\"kudzu-speak\". I agree that the %description is the best place for the\ntip. Unless someone can come up with a way to probe CD/DVD drives to\ndivulge their largest supported media size without loading ide-scsi or\nhaving that media currently in the drive.\n\n-- \nChris Kloiber\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
