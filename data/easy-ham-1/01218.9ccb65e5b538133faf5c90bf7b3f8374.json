Then for your custom built kernel, simply \"./configure\n--with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver\" from the\nalsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under\n/tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run \"depmod -a\".\n\nOf course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed\ndrivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own\nkernel.\n\nI find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's\nwhat I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a\nkernel recompiled with ACPI.\n\nMatthias\n\n-- \nClean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/\nRed Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10acpi\nLoad : 0.00 0.02 0.00\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
