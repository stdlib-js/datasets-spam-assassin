The most powerful \nof them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount \nof new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline \nbased format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a \nselectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). \n\nAlso of interest is Brian Cantoni's FTPStore[2]: _\"FTPstore is a slight \naddition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve \nthe personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back \nto the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep \nyour saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and \nat work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in \nsync.\"_ It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.\n\n[1] http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml\n[2] http://www.cantoni.org/software/amphetadesk.html\n\n\n"}
