That will do it (every time).\n\nThat is: 0 ^h -\n\nOnce you get into that state, the same traceback occurs for every\ncharacter you type, until a message is selected with the mouse.\n\nThis is looking like it might be easy to find and fix, so I'll take a\nlook at it later.\n\nkre\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n"}
