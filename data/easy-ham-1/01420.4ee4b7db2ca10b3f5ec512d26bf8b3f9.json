The \"problem\" with the ham is it tends\nto be much more tied to one person (not just intimate, but unique) than the\nspam.\n\nI save all incoming email for ten days (gzipped mbox format) before it rolls\nover and disappears.  At any one time I think I have about 8,000-10,000\nmessages.  Most of it isn't terribly personal (which I would cull before\npassing along anyway) and much of it is machine-generated, so would be of\nmarginal use.  Finally, it's all ham-n-spam mixed together.  Do we call that\nan omelette or a Denny's Grand Slam?\n\nSkip\n"}
