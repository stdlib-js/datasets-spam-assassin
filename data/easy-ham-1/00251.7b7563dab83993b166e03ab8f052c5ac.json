I have one more question though.  I\ndownloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to\nthe help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  I\nstarted by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which produced\nsome strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight?\n\n./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/\nlocal/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url\nThat worked fine so I moved to the next step.\nmake\nAt the bottem of the text I got the following messages:\nCannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el\nmake[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp'\nmake: *** [w3] Error 2\n\nWhen I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In saying\nthat this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are\nthe commands I used.\n./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url\nfollowed by the commands make and make install.\nThere is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so\nI'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.\n\nThanks again\n\nDarragh\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: \"Hunt, Bryan\" <B.Hunt@emuse-tech.com>\nTo: <macarthy@iol.ie>; <michael.conry@ucd.ie>\nCc: <ilug@linux.ie>\nSent: Thursday, September 05, 2002 5:08 PM\nSubject: OT: RE: [ILUG] Newby to Linux looking for information on cvs\n\n\n>\n> speaking of that IDE (weblogic developer) the open source version called\n> eclipse is free from eclipse.org If you are doing java development you\n> need to get this IDE .
