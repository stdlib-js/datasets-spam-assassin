Providing\nend-to-end security, the XDegrees System unifies authentication of all\nusers, provides file-level access control and encrypts all stored and\ntransferred files. Seamless integration with existing applications such as\nemail clients and Microsoft Office products allows companies to rapidly\ndeploy the XDegrees System and users to get up-and-running quickly.\"\n\nWhoa... high tech...\n\n===\nMore bits here...\nhttp://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html\n\n\"The essence of XDegrees consists of a naming system and a distributed\ndatabase that allows peers to resolve resource names. XDegrees manages these\nservices for customers on its own hosts, and sells its software to\nenterprises so they can define and run their own namespaces on in-house\nservers. You can search for a particular person (whatever device the person\nis currently using), for a particular device, for a file, or even for a web\nservice. The software that resolves resource names is called XRNS (the\neXtensible Resource Name System).\"\n\n\n\n"}
