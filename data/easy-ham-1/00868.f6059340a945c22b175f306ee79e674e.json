I think the only thing that stops us now are acts of\ndieties and total economic collapse..so no one mention the dow for the\nnext few weeks..\n\nIn preperation we drove to Best Buy tonight and picked up the test core\nfor the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wireless\nap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptop\n\nI made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up the\ncard, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire ether\nhub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the\nwebinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some\nmore (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)\nbut all in all a smooth move.\n\n\nNow the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of\nfunky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,\nessentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions get\ngoofy inside the pit.  That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet between\nthe AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting\n11mbs and at least 60% goodness.\n\n\nSome cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal works\ninthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have a\nmicrowave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bear\ncat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a bad\nthing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then I\nhope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )\n\nOk, enough testing for tonight. I gota say, being able to do this in bed\nby vncing via wifi to my desktop is a blast...oh no...wifes pillow is\nheading this way....DUCKKKKK\n\n\n(1)http://www.linksys.com/Products/product.asp?grid=23&prid=173\n\n\n"}
