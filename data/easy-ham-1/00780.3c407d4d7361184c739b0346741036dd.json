But the energy\nindustry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify\nsoaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.\n\nNow, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial\nand fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what\neveryone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.\n\nThe latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal\nadministrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed\nsupplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after\nCalifornia's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity\ngenerators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,\nalso driving up prices.\n\nAnd don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked\nthe system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a\nmemorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to\nrelieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any\ncongestion.''\n\nHow much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be\nseen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and\npolicy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.\n\nMore unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --\nincluding a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers'\ngrips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think\nthat the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least\nfavorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of\ntraditional, non-renewable energy sources.\n\nIf the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any\nfruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the\nstate amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a\nreasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.\n\nState policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.\nInstead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if\nit gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the\nutilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,''\nnotes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).\n\nIt's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --\ntempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could\nachieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better\njob. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to\ninject real competition into the market.\n\nWe do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity\ndefies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation\nis essential.\n\nBut the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers\ncontrol. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of\nboth.\n\nThe best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up\nthe use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities\nwill have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable\nsources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.\n\nBut this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer\nmodel we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer\nideas isn't enough.\n\nThe state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small\ngenerators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,\nharder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is\ncoming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.\n\nInvesting to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.\nCalifornia should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax\nincentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't\ndone badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did\nreact to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's\nlunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it\naltogether.\n\nMaybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so\ngrossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are\nmaking us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming\nwar in Iraq goes badly.\n\nIt's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to\ndrastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy\nsystem. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its\nown right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it\nhurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next\nyear.\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR. A.
