That's a steppe too far\nReply-To: zzzzteana@yahoogroups.com\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\nX-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by dogma.slashnull.org\n    id g7S8W6Z16396\n\nThe Electronic Telegraph\n\n Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far\n (Filed: 28/08/2002) \n \n \n So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham\n or sick of Sheffield.\n \n Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey\n this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps\n heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.\n \n Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied\n with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to\n emigrate to provincial Russia.\n \n After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek\n article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other\n side.\n \n \"The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city\n deep in the provinces where things are quiet,\" said Kommersant.\n \n \"In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly\n cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are\n becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.\"\n \n The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of\n tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.\n \n It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the\n famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also\n opening time in the nation's vodka shops.\n \n And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that\n \"the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be\n enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their\n life.\n \n \"The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle\n of whisky for kopecks.\"\n \n There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a\n halfpenny in sterling.\n \n The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton\n will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine\n vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among\n diehard alcoholics.\n \n While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The\n newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail\n soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British\n settler should overcome the difficulty.\n \n \"For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut\n off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.\"\n \n One or two potential emigrï¿½s might be deterred by language difficulties. There\n are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the\n Mongolian border.\n \n However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a\n deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in\n which they would like to live.\n \n France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country \"where English is only known\n by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists\".\n \n Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian\n weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.\n \n Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.\n And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place\n in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures\n that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the\n permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.\n \n Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the\n climatic problems, it said that \"thanks to global warming this difficulty will\n solve itself\".\n \n Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in\n Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.\n \n \"Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33\n million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found\n amongst our citizens.\"\n \n Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons\n surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their\n preferred new home.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
