It seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit,\n> too.\n\nBy \"meanings have evolved\" do you [or they] mean that the Hebrew words\nhave changed meaning or that our understanding of the Hebrew words have\nchanged? Or do they posit a pre-Mosaic form of the laws that had\nevolved by time of the Pentateuch?\n\n> In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was\n> actually specifically about 'man stealing -- selling a free man into\n> slavery.\n\nThis seems bogus to me. A quick check of the text indicates the the\nHebrew word in question is GANAV which elsewhere in the Pentateuch (eg\nGen 44.8) is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things.\n\nIn July 1999, I made the following comment in response to a similar\nclaim about the \"real\" meaning of one of the ten commandments:\n\n\"\"\"\n> The translations since cause problems at each successive remove\n\nWe have the original language versions, though, so this is not an\nissue.\n\n> I'm sure most everyone is familiar with the argument that the meaning of the commandment\n> is 'thou shalt not murder' rather than 'kill,'\n\nThis has nothing to do with successive translations. It is based on our\nknowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word \"ratsach\". Most modern\ntranslations I've seen translate it \"murder\" but elsewhere the word is\nused\nof an animal killing a human (something for which most English speakers\nwouldn't use the word \"murder\").\n\"\"\"\n- http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/july99/0163.html\n\n\n\nJames\n-- \n  James Tauber\n  jtauber@jtauber.com\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
