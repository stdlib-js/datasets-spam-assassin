This was a really bad argument \nagainst using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that \nthey \na) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some \nsort of autodetection and changing crap)\nb) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because \nformats have changed.\n\nRed Hat is not \"taking it easy\" on this, it's putting control in the hands \nof you, the maintainer of the machine.

You did put \n/home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use \nthe same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the \ndata as is.\n\nIf you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need \nto make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup \nand rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over \nssh.  It's the best way to make backups.\n\n> These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! \n\nIt's the other way around - your media files are backups of the CD's they \ncame from ;)\n\nGood luck,\nThomas\n-- \n\nThe Dave/Dina Project : future TV today ! - http://davedina.apestaart.org/\n<-*-                      -*->\nYou know the shape my breath will take before I let it out\n<-*- thomas@apestaart.org -*->\nURGent, the best radio on the Internet - 24/7 ! - http://urgent.rug.ac.be/\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
