If you want to stop the bootleggers do not\nrelease the data to the public.\n\nI have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlocking\nthe key gives away it's secret.\n\nthe tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take MS-XP\nfor example. only the home user is forced to register. think of the\nnightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have we\nneeded to reinstall our laptop OS? notice the amount of Mac's sold after the\nXP release. these where mostly home users that converted to Mac OS.\n\nthe new Audio CD's that have digital copy protection so not play on my\ncomputer. does this stop me from copying the CD? no. however it does make me\nreturn them and get my money back.\n\nthe more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked.\n\njef\n\n\n\n"}
