Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.\nDINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on\ntheir hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in\nRemote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked\ntogether and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid\nderivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.\nThe Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities\nwith little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a\ndescription of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see\nthem. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but\nnot the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth\neven if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a\nrenal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.\nThe definitive work on dragons is \"The Flight of Dragons\" by Peter\nDickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long\nbow. Targets do not come much bigger.\n\nTruth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is that\nthere were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard\ntheir eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They\nsurvived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.\nThey evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet\n(for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves\nbut otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.\n\nThus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the\ndinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also\nto appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote\nviewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are\ncontagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be\nencouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and\nmind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help\nso called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great\ndifficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should remove\nall perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of\nSatanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus\nif we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of\nall other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their\npsi.\n\nTHE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to\nhold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.\n\nDinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of\nrotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young\nhatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made\nthem very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to\nkeep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this\nthey had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an\nact of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the\nability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and\nso their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have\nbecome the source of all Satans, devils and demons.\n\nBirds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep\nthem warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and\nonly starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend\nto hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is\nprimarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not\nsuitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.\nAntarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,\neven if they are standing on ice.\n\nMammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act\nof love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female\ncan not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird\nsitting on a nest.\n\nDinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,\nwhile birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate\nall enemies of their young, but this is secondary.\n\nIf one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then\npurge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our\nreligions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,\nregardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to\nconcentrate on \"How to Brainwash your Neighbour\". Conscious thought has\nbuilt many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using\n\"How to care for and protect one's young\" as a foundation.\n\nThus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something \"A load of\ndinosaur's eggs\". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity\ntends to purge all malice back to its roots.\n\nIt looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,\naided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on\nvampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the\nserenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.\n\nITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take\ncontrol or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for the\nfollowing.\n\nNest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.\nEggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing\nhormones, abilities, etc.\nMind machines.\nThe original engraving or engram.\nGOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T\nhey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the\nfirst job holders.\nTIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of\ntime.\n\nMy, our, Man's timetracks, etc.\nThe time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic\nSubconscious, etc.\nEXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.\nTheir virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever\none hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the\nhigher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or\nother basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.\nEvery extinct race, etc.\nBLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via\ngenetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.\nEvery blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.\n\n\n"}
