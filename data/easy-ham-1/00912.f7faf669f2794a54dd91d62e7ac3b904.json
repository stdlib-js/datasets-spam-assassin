SOmething tells me, it'd balance\nout.  Problem is, they're silly, they don't want to do this, and\nrather than the legislation coming up with an affective means of\ncontrolling the situation (overcharging) they impose silly\nrequirements like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\n>> bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n>> So I get a check from Pac Bell today (SBC as they're called now).\n>> Turns out, they went to the trouble of printing out, signing, sealing\n>> and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole $0.33.\n>> \n>> They easily spent more than this just getting the materials together.\n>> Why the hell do companies bother to do this crap?
