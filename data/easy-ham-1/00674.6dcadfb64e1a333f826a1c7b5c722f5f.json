I\ndrink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drink\ndon't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AA\nmeetings do (try very hard) not to drink.\n\nAs to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in\nalmost any degree. Were I single, I might consider\npotential mates who partook of the less irrational\nor more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or\nBuddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan\nof the second. But someone who is both irrational\nand serious about that irrationality strikes me as\na bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who\nwas addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug\naddicts at least have the sense to battle their\nproblem, and to keep their children from suffering\nit. The religious revel in their irrationality,\nand want to raise their children in it. That's a\ndifficult difference for two parents to\nreconcile.\n\nFortunately, I am long and happily enamored of\nsomeone who has no religious tendencies.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com\n\n\n"}
