Someone seems to have done a very complete QA test on it; yesterday I installed it for the first time on an old Celeron box.  Sure, parts of it were slow, but compared to my more modern machine, everything is.  It was good; a beautiful interface that legions of 'sheep' can look at and say \"Cool; I can understand this\" and leave their shackles behind.  :)\n\n    I was struck by the massive amount of applications, both KDE and Gnome, intuitively seperated NOT by the Gnome/KDE names, but by their **meanings** instead.  It's obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more 'international'; the web browser graphic, for example, has a 'world' icon with a mouse wrapped around it. Office-apps have familiar pens, paper, and/or calculators involved.\n\n    This is a Linux that I can plop down in front of almost anyone, and they can figure it out.\n\n    At some point I'd miss the character of KDE/Gnome, and I'll probably 'hotrod' the graphics setup with my own themes, etc.  But for the wide release, this one's IT.  If you get a chance, try this; I think you'll be surprisingly pleased.\n  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Fahrlï¿½nder              Linux Zealot, Conservative, and Technomad\nEvansville, IN                    My Voyage: http://www.CounterMoon.com\nICQ  5119262\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJust machines, to make big decisions- programmed by fellas with\ncompassion and vision.
