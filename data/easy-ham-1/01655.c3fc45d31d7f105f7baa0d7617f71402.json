However, if in addition\nhave to press a 'ham' button for each ham, it starts to look\nmuch less like a win to me.  Add the time to install and setup\nthe whole machinery, and I'll just keep hitting delete.\n\nThe suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete\naction, that adds a message to the ham corpus.  I see two problems\nwith this: the ham will be a bit skewed; mail that I keep around\nwithout deleting will not be counted.  Secondly, if I by force of\nhabit happen to press the 'delete' key instead of the 'spam' key,\nI'll end up with spam in the ham, anyways.\n\nI would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham.\n\nThe obvious thing to do is to trigger on the 'spam' button,\nand at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one\nin the ham corpus, and simply remove them.  To do this we\nneed a way to compare two word count histograms, to see\nhow similar they are.  Any ideas ?\n\nAlso, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.\nIf they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),\nfalse positives become the senders problem, to rewrite\nto remove the spam smell.\n\nIn a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much\nsmaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be\nslightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from\nthe ham corpus.  This should make it easier to keep it clean.\n\nHaving a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,\nthere's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,\nand we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,\nthat didn't get deleted by the spam filtering.\n\nIt might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from\nthe spam corpus, in case of user ooops.\n\n\t/Paul\n\n"}
