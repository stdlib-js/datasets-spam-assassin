Although the PhD student has been\nblind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery\nand drinks.\n\n\"I'm putting your plate right in front of you,\" Zimmermann said. \"I can't\nfind my mouth,\" one voice replied out of the dark. \"I wonder what this dish\nis -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?\" another invisible guest said.\n\nIn the \"unsicht-Bar,\" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose\ncomplete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like\na fish, meat or vegetarian option.\n\n\"We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and\nsmelling,\" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and\nsight-restricted people, which is running the bar.\n\n\"People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over\nand are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent,\" he\nadded.\n\nOf the 30 staff, 22 are blind.\n\nAn average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to\nhelp, Scharnbach said.\n\nAnd at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have\nactually been eating.\n\n\n\n"}
