There's good design and bad design. \nThere's good testing and bad testing.  The problem\nis, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody\ndoes.  I think \"best practices\" hasn't caught up\non main street Web enablement yet.  There's some\nreally great packages on how to do this stuff and\nin fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed\nto be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XForms\nand  XHTML.  You can shoot yourself in the foot and\npeople usually do.  What the problem is, they don't\neven recognize that they're gimpy--ever.  They just\nkeeping trundling along making a mess of everything\nassured in their job security that they can build\nWeb forms without even caring if they can be\nused or not beyond their test machine.\n\nIf you had a piece of software and a security warning\ncame out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software?\nWouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally\nbroken 4 years and 11 months ago?  What I want to know\nis why would someone use Web forms best practices from\n5 years ago?  I mean you can get a college degree in that\ntime.  Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows\nor Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window\nmanager?  Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for\na brief period of time, but they are completely useless\nexcept for some terminal based replacement applications. \n\nThe bottom line is, if you can't get across the\nbridge, then it's broken regardless of whose fault\nit really is, and it's the business that \nneeds to take responsibility as they are the ones that\nwanted to put the bridge there in the first place. \n\n\nGreg\n\n\n"}
