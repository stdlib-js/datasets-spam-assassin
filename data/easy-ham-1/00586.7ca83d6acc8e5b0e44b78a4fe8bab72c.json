I often have the goods in my possession before I settle\nthe paycheck.\n\nSecond, 'not being paid for a little food' is an awfully big deal in\nIndia.  It isn't far from stealing the only food my children have so\nI'll have to watch them starve.  The margin of survival is very, very,\nthin.\n\nSo yes.  In my particular reality distortion field 'not paying for a\nlittle food' in India is akin to a direct act of violence intended to\ncause suffering if not death on the victims family.  That such an act\ntriggers a violent response is, IMHO, hardly surprising.\n\nIn other words, as far as I could tell the people on the train fired the\nfirst shot.\n\nWith all of that said I still don't know if this happened or not.  Nor\ndo I know for sure that the margin of survival for those Muslim vendors\nwas that thin.\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Stephen D.
