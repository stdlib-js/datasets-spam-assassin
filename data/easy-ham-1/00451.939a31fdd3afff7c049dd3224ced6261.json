(ok, so we knew that already)\n\nALB> -------------\n\nALB> Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand\nALB> Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET\nALB> By Andrew Marshall\n\nALB> BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand\nALB> looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.\n\nALB> \"The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all\nALB> my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,\" he said. \"I\nALB> knew then there was something special.\"\n\nALB> Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet\nALB> -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,\nALB> who is expecting their first child.\n\nALB> Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women\nALB> in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that\nALB> often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand\nALB> in search of a wife.\n\nALB> \"I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,\" he said. \"I knew I\nALB> found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.\"\n\nALB> Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in\nALB> touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and\nALB> the couple married.\n\nALB> MR. MARRIAGE\n\nALB> Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency\nALB> Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself \"Mr. Marriage,\"\nALB> started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction\nALB> agency.\n\nALB> Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.\n\nALB> \"In the last five years we've done about 400,\" he said. \"To the best of my\nALB> knowledge, they have all been successful.\"\n\nALB> Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that\nALB> require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.\nALB> Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women\nALB> looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.\n\nALB> Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's\nALB> office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and\nALB> language problems.\n\nALB> \"We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,\"\nALB> Lynch said. \"But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.\"\n\nALB> After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know\nALB> each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every\nALB> client has found a potential wife.\n\nALB> \"At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and\nALB> think he hasn't made his mind up,\" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,\nALB> usually within the next year.\n\nALB> Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a\nALB> Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less\nALB> than 10 percent have broken up.\n\nALB> Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just\nALB> arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.\n\nALB> \"Sometimes they are very nervous,\" she said. \"And sometimes they are very\nALB> impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm\nALB> down, OK, we'll talk.\"'\n\nALB> But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife\nALB> and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives\nALB> for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic\nALB> stress disorder.\n\nALB> WHY?\n\nALB> Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics\nALB> say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to\nALB> form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of\nALB> impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.\n\nALB> But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is\nALB> no reason to object. \"If you talk about people who are needy, I think\nALB> everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I\nALB> need Wan,\" he said.\n\nALB> \"Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no\nALB> secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem\nALB> with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to\nALB> their future husband.\"\n\nALB> Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they\nALB> choose to use his agency.\n\nALB> His brochure promises an alternative to the \"kind of de-feminized,\nALB> over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British\nALB> singles scene,\" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are\nALB> not \"God's gift to women.\"\n\nALB> Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their\nALB> own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.\n\nALB> \"They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques\nALB> or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?\nALB> Impossible,\" she said.\n\nALB> \"Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are\nALB> good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from\nALB> ladies from other countries.\"\n\nALB> Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,\nALB> the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also\nALB> not a major obstacle.\n\nALB> \"Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having\nALB> a husband who is significantly older,\" Lynch said. \"When I met my wife she\nALB> couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic\nALB> dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up\nALB> very quickly.\"\n\nALB> Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move\nALB> to the West.\n\nALB> \"We have kitchens, we have study classes,\" Roongthip said. \"We teach them\nALB> how to eat, and when to make tea.\"\n\nALB> PITFALLS\n\nALB> But not all dreams come true. \"Bee\" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to\nALB> Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is\nALB> back in Bangkok, sad and angry.\n\nALB> \"He had no friends, and I was so lonely,\" she said. \"I tried to make him\nALB> happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never\nALB> spoke to me.\"\n\nALB> Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. \"I thought I would be happy\nALB> there,\" she said. \"But it was the worst time of my life.\"\n\nALB> Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure\nALB> unsuitable candidates are weeded out.\n\nALB> \"We are ethical and professional,\" he said. \"We will not take on all\nALB> comers.\"\n\nALB> Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the\nALB> arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,\nALB> looking for a foreign husband.\n\nALB> \"Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,\"\nALB> Moylan said. \"But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n\n"}
