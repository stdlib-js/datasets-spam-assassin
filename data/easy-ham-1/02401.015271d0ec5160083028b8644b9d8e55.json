New Tokyo toities \nsport speech-recognition, air-conditioning, and body-chemistry monitors: \n\n    Japan's toilet wars started in February, when Matsushita engineers here \n    unveiled a toilet seat equipped with electrodes that send a mild electric \n    charge through the user's buttocks, yielding a digital measurement of \n    body-fat ratio. \n\n    Unimpressed, engineers from a rival company, Inax, counterattacked in April \n    with a toilet that glows in the dark and whirs up its lid after an infrared \n    sensor detects a human being. When in use, the toilet plays any of six \n    soundtracks, including chirping birds, rushing water, tinkling wind chimes, \n    or the strumming of a traditional Japanese harp.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, May[3]!_)\n\n[1] http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/international/asia/08JAPA.html\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/MQCtPB8LcUjsc\n[3] http://www.filterfine.com\n\n\n"}
