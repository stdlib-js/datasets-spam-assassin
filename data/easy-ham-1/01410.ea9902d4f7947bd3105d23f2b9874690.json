No mass production CDs, maybe mass personalised d/l like Sun \nJDK.\n\nNothing is fixed yet, we are looking at the way a software can be protected \nfrom unauthorized utilisation.  \n\nIs the use of \"trusted hardware\" really worth it ?  Does it really make it \nmore secure ?  Look at the DVDs.\n\n- -- \nYannick Gingras\nCoder for OBB : Obdurately Buteonine Bellwether\nhttp://OpenBeatBox.org\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: For info see http://www.gnupg.org\n\niD8DBQE9dRrnuv7G0DNFO+QRAk8nAKClAhTmyrUgP3ko+DEjcvj0mqfjzACgwQvo\nWZ6/CMUA23HCMZVycd7XD1Q=\n=V2G8\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n"}
