Then we\n  go Rambo.\n\nHe has tactfully left out the hard\nrealists*; as for the rest I gather\nwilsonians play the idealists, and\nhamiltonians act where values and\ninterests intersect, and jacksonians \nact only when values and interests\noverlap.\n\nKissinger himself seems to be a\nHamiltonian; much of the book is\nabout how he thinks we ought to\nbe shaping the balance of power\nin various foreign regions.\n\nMaybe I've been too affected by\nKant, but I can't see that such\na strategy works unless one can\ncount on a Bismarck runnning it:\nhow lopsided does the US look if\neveryone tries to run a balance\nof power politics?\n\n- -Dave\n\n*\n> The road to empire leads to domestic decay because, in time, the claims\n> of omnipotence erode domestic restraints.

In other\ntraditions, a king is a legitimate\ntyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate\nking.  In the US, I'd hope that we,\nlike Samuel, wouldn't naturally make\nsuch fine distinctions.\n\n\n"}
