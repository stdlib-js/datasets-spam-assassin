BANNED CD!\nDate: Sun, 21 Jul 2002 16:54:45 -1600\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n\tcharset=\"Windows-1252\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nReply-To: \"peter\"weou345@msn.com\n\n*****************BANNEDCD::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::>NET******************\n\nI have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the \"moral decay of society\" by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from \nthis hard-to-find information. \n\nSo I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! \n\nWith this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! \n  \n\nOr maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. \n\nNeed to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! \nUsing the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely \nnew identity. \n\nObviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. \n\n\n Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! \n\nWhy are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. \nAnd you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will \nhave the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS \ntax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or \nex-husband, and MUCH more!\n\nPlease Click the URL for the Detail! \n\nhttp://%32%317.%31%30%36.%355%2E97\n \n\n{%RAND%}\nYou are receiving this special offer because you have provided permission to receive third party email communications regarding special online promotions or offers.
