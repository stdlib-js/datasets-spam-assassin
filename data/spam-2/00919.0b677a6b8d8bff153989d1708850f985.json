The companies that executed the\ncontracts have been duly paid and the contracts\ncommissioned leaving the sum of US$22.5 Million\nfloating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of\nNigeria  ready for payment.\n\nI have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by\nmy colleagues in the committee to look for an overseas\npartner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$22.5M\nlegally subcontracting the entitlement to you/your\ncompany. This is bearing in mind that our  civil\nservice code of conduct forbids us from owning \nforeign company or running  foreign account while in\ngovernment service hence the need for an overseas\npartner.\n\nWe have agreed that the funds will be shared thus\nafter it has been paid into your account:\n(1) 25% of the money will go to you for acting as the\nbeneficiary of the fund.\n(2) 5% has been set aside as an abstract projection\nfor reimbursment to both parties for incidental\nexpences that may be incurred in the course of the\ntransaction.\n(3) 70% to us the government officials (with  which we\nwish to commence an importation business in\nconjunction with you ). \n \nAll logistics are in place and all modalities worked\nout for the smooth conclusion of the transaction \nwithin ten to fourteen days of commencement after\nreceipt of the following information:  Your  full\nname/ company name, address, company's details &\nactivities, telephone & fax numbers.\n\nThese information will enable us make the applications\nand lodge claims to the concerned ministries &\nagencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent\nto state here that this transaction is entirely  based\non trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque\ndrawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria\ncorrespondent bankers in America, Asia and Europe is\ngoing to be made in your name.Please acknowledge the\nreceipt of this letter  using my personal E-mail\naddress.\n\nYours Faithfully, \n\nDR.OLUFEMI COKER.\n\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
