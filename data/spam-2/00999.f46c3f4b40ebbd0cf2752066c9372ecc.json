<br><br>\nWe'll get you <i><u>qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity.</u></i> <br><br>\n<b>Period.</b> <br><br>\nNo qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense. <br><br>\nWe'll do it <i><u>quickly,</u></i> and <i><u>professionally</u></i>. <br><br>\n<i>And we won't ask you for a <u>single dime</u> without <b>guaranteeing</b> <u>results</u>!<br><br>\n<br>\n</i><b><u>Here's How We Generate Our Leads...<br><br>\n</u></b>-<b> All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!<br><br>\n</b>- One source we use for Lead-generation is a <b>Business Opportunity<br>\nSeeker Lead List</b> of people who have requested info. about making <br>\nextra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,<br>\nor responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.<br><br>\n- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.<br>\nWe have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,<br>\nplays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in<br>\nmaking money from home.&nbsp; If they are, the system records their<br>\nname and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.<br><br>\n- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then<br>\n<b>PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices </b>and the following <br>\ninfo. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):<br><br>\n<b>Name:<br>\nEmail:<br>\nPhone:<br>\nBest time to call:<br>\nState:<br>\nReason they want to work from home!:<br>\nHow much they want to make per month:<br>\nHow much time they can commit per week:<br>\nHow much money they have available for startup:<br>\nIf they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:<br><br>\nWe'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no<br>\nmore than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.<br><br>\n</b>- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you, <br>\nfrom which the results are then forwarded to you by email.<br><br>\n- This way, <b>you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time*</b> <br>\n(only minutes old).&nbsp; Never more than 24 hours old.&nbsp; Guaranteed!<br><br>\n- We <b>GUARANTEE</b> that you'll receive <u>AT LEAST</u> a valid <u>Name</u>, <br>\n<u>Phone Number</u> and the <u>Time-Date Stamp</u> corresponding to when<br>\nthe Lead was generated!&nbsp; However, almost ALL leads will have<br>\nALL of the information asked above.<br><br>\n<br>\n<b>Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:<br><br>\n</b>1. They will be <b>Extremely Qualified</b> due to the nature of the <br>\nqualifying questions that will be asked (above).<br><br>\n2. They are <b>Super-Fresh!</b>&nbsp; Delivered in Real-Time only <b>moments <br>\n</b>after they are contacted and qualified!&nbsp; (Not 30-120 days old)<br><br>\n3. They're <b>Targeted.</b>&nbsp; Each Lead we generate originates from a<br>\ntargeted list of business opportunity seekers.<br><br>\n4. They're <b>Highly Receptive!</b>&nbsp; <b>Receptivity is very, very high</b> <br>\nbecause they <b>aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching <br>\nthem on opportunities!</b>&nbsp; Also they'll remember speaking to <br>\nsomeone over the phone.&nbsp; Especially since <b>we tell them to <br>\nexpect your call!<br><br>\n</b>5. <b>No &quot;feast or famine&quot;</b> activity.&nbsp; Leads will be coming in <br>\nregularly.&nbsp; You dictate the flow!<br><br>\n6. <b>No more cold calls!&nbsp; </b>We tell your prospects you'll be calling.<br><br>\n7. You can <b>*personalize* your approach</b> with the info. you <br>\nget with each Lead!<br><br>\n8. <b>Save Time.&nbsp; </b>Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.<br><br>\n9. <b>Lower &quot;burnout&quot; factor.</b>&nbsp; Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier <br>\nto pick up the phone, day in and day out.<br><br>\n10. You can <b>sort your Leads</b> based on their responses and call the<br>\nhottest ones first.<br><br>\n11. You can <b>get new reps started quicker</b> using these Leads due <br>\nto <b>higher closing ratios</b>.&nbsp; Of course, this builds faster and stronger <br>\nmomentum, and skyrockets &quot;new rep retention&quot; as a result of <br>\n&quot;quick successes&quot;.<br><br>\n12. The <b>Leads will be uniform </b>- almost all leads will have the info. <br>\nindicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)<br><br>\n13.
