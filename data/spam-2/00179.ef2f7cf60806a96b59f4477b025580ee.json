You are therefore NOT obliged\nto reply. However, if you do, and the conditions are\nright, you will be amply compensated. It is also\npertinent to add that I am using an assumed name, and\nfree web based email addresses for my personal\nprotection .\n \nIn order to give you a background of this \"business\ntransaction\", please check the website  \n\nhttp://news.ft.com/ft/gx.cgi/ftc?pagename=View&c=Article&cid=FT3PQPP45QC\n\nBefore proceeding further, please permit me to give\nyou more background on the Abacha family \"MILLIONS\" as\nit is now known; please check the following websites\n \nhttp://www.oneworld.org/ips2/aug98/17_29_059.html\n\nhttp://www.odiousdebts.org/odiousdebts/index.cfm?DSP=content&ContentID=974\n\nI have taken some pains to give you readings on the\nAbacha Family fortunes; They are of  course a matter\nof public record, and CONCLUSIVELY PROVES INDEED THAT\nGENERAL SANI ABACHA TRANSFERRED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS\nOUT OF NIGERIA ! However, it is conceivable and even\nlogical that NOT ALL OF THE FORTUNE HAS BEEN\n\"DISCOVERED\" OR FROZEN BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS IN\nSYMPATHY AND ON THE REQUEST OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT\nOF NIGERIA. AND THIS IS A FACT!\n\nThe truth of the matter is that much more of the\nAbacha fortunes are still hidden , their location a\nclosely guarded secret; Her Excellency, Hajia\nAbacha,widow of Gen. Sani Abacha, ex-head of\nState of Nigeria, who died June 8, 1998\nand her immediate family are under house arrest in\nNigeria. It is therefore my job to search out a\nreliable person, a complete stranger to help\ntransfer/secure a negotiated amount from the still\nhidden millions of Dollars.  The right person must\npass a background check in order to avoid my being\nbetrayed to the AUTHORITIES, as happened in the past.\nIt is now obvious why I will be using an assumed name\nfor the moment. All precautions will be taken to avoid\nleakages. Though I am using the internet which is\nlargely unsafe, as soon as I get a \"reliable\"\ncandidate, I will introduce security measures for\nevery body's protection. For the moment I am simply a\n\"Contact Person\" for the REAL Abacha family.\n\nIn sum, the person I am looking for is an individual\nor corporate body that is able to provide one or more\nBank Accounts into which arrangements will be made to\ntransfer US$5,000,000.00 to US$10,000,000.00 every\nweek; The routine, periodic transfers in small\ninstalments are designed to avoid raising suspicion in\nthe wrong quarters. These transfers will be secure and\nproperly legal, and with all proper bank\ndocumentation. The right person may need to establish \nfresh/new RECEIVING BANK accounts free from legal or\nfinancial encumbrances. Persons with bad credit rating\n, undischarged bankrupts, companies in receivership\nand minors need not reply; Because of the stature and\nconfidentiality of this proposed transaction, a\nsuccessful candidate will receive 25% of all\ntransfers. Other Conditions, including maximum secrecy\nand confidentiality  apply. \n\nIf you are interested in helping this family, and if\nyou can meet our strict conditions, please reply to\nall email addresses listed below. In your reply please\ninclude your phone, fax and contact address. In the\nevent you do not meet our conditions after a brief\nback ground check, you will be communicated\naccordingly.
