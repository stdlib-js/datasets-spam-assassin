After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some \ncarriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, \nthe future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry \nthat have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems \nmean opportunity. &quot;Every major industry in the history of \nthe United States has experienced a similar transformation, from \nthe railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s \nto the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,&quot; says <a href=\"http://www.commweb.com/article/COM20010403S0001\">Robert \nSaunders</a>, director of the Eastern Management Group market \nresearch firm. <a href=\"http://www.eftia.com/about/exec/dean.html\">Christopher \nDean</a>, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says &quot;We are seeing all \nthe people that are the survivors.

(<a href=\"http://moneycentral.msn.com/scripts/webquote.dll?ipage=qd&Symbol=igtt&SUBMIT1=Go\">OTCBB: \nIGTT</a>) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since \nlate May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its \nbusiness plan, we believe this company will help lead the way \nup for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our \nstrongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest \nRating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous \nGrowth Potential </strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not \ngreater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, \nTalk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), <a href=\"http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=talk&sid=0&o_symb=talk&freq=1&time=7\">share \nprice began to explode in April of this year moving from just \nover $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June</a>. Talk America \nHoldings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but \ntoday has a market cap of $267 million.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. \nUsing the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well \nbe trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market \ncap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. \nSo you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right \n for investors to get in on the ground floor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>The <em>InDigNet</em> Strategy</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company \nthat provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated \ncommunication solution.

The Company will offer data, local, long distance and \nwireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the \nCompany to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the \ncapital burden of building a communication network. The Company&#8217;s \nstrategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market \ncommunication companies and attractively priced <a href=\"http://webopedia.com/TERM/I/ISP.html\">Internet \nService Providers </a>(ISPs). <em>The Company recently completed \nits acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect</em>. \nInDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow \nrevenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion \nin commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, \nor 33% of the country&#8217;s total market, and this spending \nis expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years. \n<em>Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter</em>. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">The IGTT web site: <a href=\"http://www.indiginet.com\">www.indiginet.com</a></p>\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>The<em> </em>IT Market</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Based on recent studies, the country&#8217;s 7.4 \nmillion SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of \n<a href=\"http://webopedia.com/TERM/I/IT.html\">IT</a> and data \ncommunications, including Internet access, web services, business \nsoftware and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 \nbillion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over \n2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher \nIDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, \ngrowing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for \nthe first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in \n2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by \n3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth \nof 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent \nin 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat \ngrowth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will \nreturn to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown \nin China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa \nand Poland. <em>Source: <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/en_US/st/aboutIDC.jhtml;jsessionid=2J2GJSTTFNK4MCTFA4FCFGAKMUDYWIWD\">IDC</a></em></p>\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Particulars</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our \nStrong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following \nreasons:</p>\n<p align=\"left\">1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer \nbases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively \npriced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell \nits bundled service package to the acquired customer base that \nwill form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all \ntypes of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, \nand data. </p>\n<p align=\"left\"><br>\n2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front \nRange communities but in particular the education vertical market \nhas recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data \nnetwork into the existing campus network. The Company's customers \ninclude <a href=\"http://www.usoc.org/\">United States Olympic Committee</a> \n(USOC), <a href=\"http://www.du.edu/\">University of Denver</a>, \nand <a href=\"http://www.colostate.edu/\">Colorado State University</a>. \n</p>\n<p align=\"left\"><br>\n3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues \nto acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy \ncourt and smaller communication providers with valuable customer \nbases. Each of the targeted companies are within the Company's \nfootprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the \nCompany's embedded customer base. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Investment Consideration</strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\">InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the \nthree months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 \nin Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth \nrate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first \nyear of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more \nand more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors \nwill turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment \ndollars. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p align=\"left\">NEWS - InDigiNet, Inc.
