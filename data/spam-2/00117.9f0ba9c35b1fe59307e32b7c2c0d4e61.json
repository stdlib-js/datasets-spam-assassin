My \n>defragmentor  keeps starting over and over and my scan \n>disk never finds anything wrong, but there has to be. \n\nDear Nicety,\n\nAs regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking \nup your computer I'm afraid your \"SOL\" as finding a true solution.  \nThere are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts \nresulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many \nprograms don't release memory when you exit.  When working \nin Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a \nregular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened \nand closed several different applications.\n\nBack in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional,\nwrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating\nsystem vs Windows NT.  You can read it at \nhttp://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/.  What was true back then is \neven truer today.  Every current \"worm\" you are hearing about \non the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems. \n\n So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change \nthe OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of \nweeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running \nI can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over. \nI have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and \nthe price is right -- free.\n\nJim Shofstall\nwebmaster@wonderpaint.com\nhttp://www.wonderpaint.com\n\n______________________________________________________\n\n\n>>>>>> WEBSITE SHOWCASES <<<<<<\n\nExamine carefully - those with email addresses included WILL\ntrade links with you, you are encouraged to contact them.

They are both very attractive and well \npresented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been \na little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site, \npreparing me for the site that it links to, and having a \nrelationship to it.\n\nWhat I did feel most, was that I was expecting something \nrelated to the url  \"prosperouswomen\" to come up, as this \n\"word\" was what caught my attention and caused me to \nclick in the first place.\n\nI feel the book page should be a tool for the \"PW\" page and \nnot a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the \nbook site could be a link or a popup or an additional page.\n(You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)\n\nWith these:\n\nFind out how you can receive the free book.\nEmail us at directions4U@aol.com        \nand\nFor this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing \nwrite to us at directions4U@aol.com\n\nI would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than \ncopy and paste.\n\nVery nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them. \n(and I have ordered the book!)\n~~~~\n\nI waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.  \nCould not determine if this was related to volume of graphics \nor where we were headed.\n~~~~\n\nVery clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.\n\nDon't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish \nbetween the links and that which is not.\n\nI finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also \nlinked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that \nlink more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.\n\nIf you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a \nrequest message to an aol email address you would get more \nrequests, and also might be able to automate this process.\n~~~~\n\nI loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point.\nIt also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.  \nIf only other sites we so simplistic!\n~~~~\n\nWith the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact \non Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences \nin the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box \nwith \"Life Changeing Insight\" needs the 'e' taken out of \n'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended \nto go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100 \nyear old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of \nusing the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where \nor how or by whom it was discovered.\n\nThe message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that \nwould make the site more effective (on getting people to request \nthe book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in \nwhat format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to \norder instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form \nfor this just about anywhere.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n______________________________________________________\nmoderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\nposting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com\n______________________________________________________\n\nSend posts and questions (or your answers) to:\n   mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com\nPlease send suggestions and comments to:\n   mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\n\nTo change your subscribed address, send both new\nand old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\nSee below for unsubscribe instructions.\n\nCopyright 2001 AEOpublishing\n\n----- End of Your Membership Exchange\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis email has been sent to jm@netnoteinc.com at your \nrequest, by Your Membership Newsletter Services.\n\nVisit our Subscription Center to edit your interests or unsubscribe.\nhttp://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.6vihnja6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.com\n\nView our privacy policy: http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jsp\n\nPowered by \nConstant Contact(R)\nwww.constantcontact.com\n--90840724.996748272348.JavaMail.RovAdmin.rovweb003\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\n\n<HTML>\n<!-- \n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML-FORMATTED MESSAGE BELOW\n\nThe remainder of this message is in HTML format for use by email\nclients that can properly display it.

They are both very attractive and well\n<br>presented.&nbsp; In my opinion, the book site could have been\n<br>a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site,\n<br>preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a\n<br>relationship to it.\n<p>What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something\n<br>related to the url&nbsp; \"prosperouswomen\" to come up, as this\n<br>\"word\" was what caught my attention and caused me to\n<br>click in the first place.\n<p>I feel the book page should be a tool for the \"PW\" page and\n<br>not a preface to it.&nbsp; The main site should be the PW and the\n<br>book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page.\n<br>(You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)\n<p>With these:\n<p>Find out how you can receive the free book.\n<br>Email us at directions4U@aol.com\n<br>and\n<br>For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing\n<br>write to us at directions4U@aol.com\n<p>I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than\n<br>copy and paste.\n<p>Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them.\n<br>(and I have ordered the book!)\n<br>~~~~\n<p>I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.\n<br>Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics\n<br>or where we were headed.\n<br>~~~~\n<p>Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.\n<p>Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish\n<br>between the links and that which is not.\n<p>I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also\n<br>linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that\n<br>link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.\n<p>If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a\n<br>request message to an aol email address you would get more\n<br>requests, and also might be able to automate this process.\n<br>~~~~\n<p>I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point.\n<br>It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.\n<br>If only other sites we so simplistic!\n<br>~~~~\n<p>With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact\n<br>on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences\n<br>in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box\n<br>with \"Life Changeing Insight\" needs the 'e' taken out of\n<br>'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended\n<br>to go from side to side. In the first paragraph&nbsp; '... an amazing\n100\n<br>year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead\nof\n<br>using the word 'text'.&nbsp; Also it would add credibility to say where\n<br>or how or by whom it was discovered.\n<p>The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that\n<br>would make the site more effective (on getting people to request\n<br>the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in\n<br>what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to\n<br>order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form\n<br>for this just about anywhere.\n<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<br>______________________________________________________\n\t\t<p><br>moderator: Amy Mossel&nbsp; <a href=\"mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\">Moderator</a>\n<br>posting:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com\">MyInput@AEOpublishing.com</a>\n<br>______________________________________________________\n<p>Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com\">MyInput@AEOpublishing.com</a>\n<br>Please send suggestions and comments to:\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\">Moderator@AEOpublishing.com</a>\n<p>To change your subscribed address, send both new\n<br>and old address to <a href=\"mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\">Moderator@AEOpublishing.com</a>\n<br>See below for unsubscribe instructions.\n<p>Copyright 2001 AEOpublishing\n<p>----- End of Your Membership Exchange\n\t\t<!-- End Letter Body -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<!-- Begin Signature  -->\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t<br>\n\t\t<hr width=\"60%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\" NOSHADE>\n\t\t<br>\n\t\t\n\n\t\t<!-- End Signature  -->\n\t\t</font>\n\t\t</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t</table>\n\t<!-- End Content Table -->\n\t</td>\n\t<td width=\"25\" bgcolor=\"#870000\">�</td>\n</tr>\n<!-- Begin Phone Number Row -->\n<tr>\n\t<td width=\"25\" bgcolor=\"#870000\">�</td>\n\t<td width=\"525\" bgcolor=\"#870000\" align=\"right\"><font face=\"Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\" size=\"1\" color=\"#FFFFFF\"> </font></td>\n\t<td width=\"25\"><img src=\"http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/images/letters/red-corner-br.gif\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></td>\n</tr>\n<!-- End Phone Number Row -->\n<tr>\n\t<td colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" align=\"center\">\n\t<!--  You are required by your Constant Contact user agreement to\n      provide the opt-out link shown below as by the property 'OptOut' -->\n\n\t<font face=\"Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\" size=\"1\">\n\t<br>This email was sent to jm@netnoteinc.com, at your request, by <a href=\"http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/sa/s.jsp?id=bd7n7877.6vihnja6\">Your Membership Newsletter Services</a>.  \n\t<br>Visit our Subscription Center to <a href=\"http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.6vihnja6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.com\">edit</a> your interests or <a href=\"http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.6vihnja6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.com\">unsubscribe</a>.\n\t<br>View our <a href=\"http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jsp\">privacy policy</a>.\n\t<p>Powered by\n\t<br><a href=\"http://www.constantcontact.com/index.jsp?cc=ctrlr\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/images/cc-logo-color-sm.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Constant Contact\"></a>\n\t</font>\n\t<!-- end opt-out area -->\n\t</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n</center>\n</body>\n</html>\n--90840724.996748272348.JavaMail.RovAdmin.rovweb003--\n\n\n\n"}
