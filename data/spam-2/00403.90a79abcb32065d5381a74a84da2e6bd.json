Read this email to the end, follow the\ninstructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your\nretirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. I\nknow what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these\nbefore either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25\ngoing to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing\nthis same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know why\nthat day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come close\nto imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor.\n\nRead on.  It's true. Every word of it. It's legal, and it's ethical.\nNot only are you making money from your own business, you're\nhelping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams.\nGive it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't get\nAT LEAST a modest return on your start up capital.\n\n\nOkay - here's the scoop on CashByNet (CBN):\n\n==================================================\n\nDue to the popularity of this particular email business, and the\nbusiness potential of the Internet, a national weekly news program\nrecently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program\nto see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money.\n\nTheir findings proved that there are \"absolutely NO LAWS prohibiting\nthe participation in the program, and if people can follow a few\nsimple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only\n$25 in startup costs.\"\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS\nATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  THE MORE PEOPLE\nWHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOU\nWILL MAKE.\n\nThis is what one had to say:\n\n\"I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, but\neach time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going out\nthat night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it in\nthis business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed.\nTwo weeks went by . . . . nothing.  Three weeks . . . . $50 dollars\nrolled in.  At this point I was just relieved to get my money back.\nThen it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find\n$580 in $5 bills waiting for me.  Its been about 8 months now, and I\njust bought a new Mercedes . . . black :)  The startup costs are so\nsmall, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week.\nGive it a shot - what do you have to lose?\"\n\nPam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey.\n==================================================\n\nAnother said:\n\n\"Programs like this have been around for a long time but I never\nbelieved in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots to\nwin the Super Bowl.  I got this email the following morning, and I\nfelt like gambling.  I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other\n$25 paying a parking ticket.  I followed the instructions\nmeticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back.\nAs soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupled\nmy $25.  I'd take that over the Patriots any day.  I got excited, and\nthat's when it started to explode.  In less than 6 weeks I was already\nup $9500 bucks.  It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped.\nOn an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail.  I always\nsay that everything happens for a reason, and I feel that this was meant\nto be, maybe it is for you too. Just stick to the steps, do everything it\nsays - and all of your hopes and dreams will be real - I promise.\"\n\nGreg Moran, Boston, MA.\n\nFor more success stories and photos, go to http://www.cashbynet.net\n\n\n\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME\nTRUE, GUARANTEED.\n\nBE SURE TO SAVE A COPY OF THIS EMAIL AS A TEXT DOCUMENT FOR REFERENCE!!!!\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n=====Order all 5 reports from your personal CBN money list below =====\n\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE\nORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON\nTHAT LIST next to the report.

THIS IS CRITICAL TO THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR BUSINESS AND\nSUBSEQUENTLY THE SIZE OF YOUR PROFITS.****\n\nAs soon as you receive all 5 reports via email SAVE A COPY OF THEM!\nThese are the products that your customers are paying for. Not only do\nthese reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture,\nyou will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment.\nTo assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5\nreports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to\nsend bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified\nads and much more.\n\nThere are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture going:\n\n\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n==================================================\n\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,\nand we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails\neach. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2%\n(2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just\nsay it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of\nthousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this\nexample, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\n\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  Those 10\npeople responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.\nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100\npeople responded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000\ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\n\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail\nsent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000\n(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\nReport # 5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million\ndollars).\n\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....\n$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nREMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF\n5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if\neveryone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails\neach or more?\n\nTHE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. VISIT CBN AT\nhttp://www.cashbynet.net/Calculator/ to\nplug in your own numbers and see the results.\n\n\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n==================================================\n\nAdvertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds\nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet\nwill easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly\nsuggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to\nbecome more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports.\nRemember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure\nproper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you.\n\n\n$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$\n\nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success:\n\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2\nweeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.\n\n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you\nshould receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not,\ncontinue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.\n\n**ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN\nRELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash\nwill continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a\ndifferent report.\n\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are\nordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER\nBATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT\nto the income you can generate from this business !!!\n=================================================\n\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF CASH BY NET:\n\nCash By Net has become a very popular business for many sole\nproprietors.
