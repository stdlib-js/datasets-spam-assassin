I am\ncontacting you in view of the fact that we will \nbe of\ngreat assistance to each other likewise \ndeveloping a\ncordial relationship.\n\nI currently have within my reach the sum of \nthirty\nsix million United States Dollars \n(US$36,000,000) in\ncash, which I intend to use for investment \npurposes\nspecifically in your country. This money came \nas a\nresult of a payback contract deal between my \nlate\nhusband and a Russian firm on our country's\nMulti-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The\nRussian partners returned my husbands share of\nUS$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with \nmy\nlate husband's security company in Nigeria of \nwhich I\nam a director. Right now the new civilian \ngovernment\nhave intensified their probe on my husband's \nfinancial\nresources and they have revoked our licenses \nthat\nallows us to own a financial and oil company. \nIn view\nof this, I acted very fast to withdraw the\nUS$36,000,000 from the company's vault and \ndeposited\nit in a privately erected security safe abroad.\n\nNo record ever existed concerning the money \nneither is\nthe money traceable by the Government because \nthere is\nno documentation showing that we received the \nmoney\nfrom the Russians.\n\nDue to the current situation in the country \nconcerning\nGovernment attitude towards my family, it has \nbecome\nquite impossible for me to make use of this \nmoney\nwithin, thus I seek assistance to transfer this \nmoney\ninto your safe bank account. On your consent, I \nshall expect\nyou to contact me urgently to enable us discuss\ndetails of this transaction.\n\nBearing in mind that your assistance is needed \nto\ntransfer the funds, I propose a commission of \n20% of\nthe total sum to you for the expected services \nand\nassistance. Your urgent response is highly \nneeded so\nas to stop further contacts. all correspondent \nshould be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con\nor you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this \nopportunity to implore you to exercise the most \nutmost\nindulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily\nconfidential what ever your decision while I \nawait your\nprompt response.\n\nBest personal regards,\n\nMRS MARIAM ABACHA.\n\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing \nreal-time communications platform!
