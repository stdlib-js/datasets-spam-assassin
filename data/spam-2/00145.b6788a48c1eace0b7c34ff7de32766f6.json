When working in Windoze I've always taken the \napproach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, \n</snip>\n\nI believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much \nnegates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer \nfor reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's \nfavourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I \nhave to make it do anything useful. \n\nIf you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE \ndownload called FreeMem which you can get here;\nhttp://www.meikel.com\n\nThis utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you \nalso get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released. \nThis may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be \nrunning at peak performance all the time and much easier than \nconstant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these \nlittle third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to \nsearch for.\n\nHTH.

It's very flashy and maybe\njust a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way around\nyour site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gone\nthree pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful to\nmake your front page navigation a little less confusing?\n\nThe \"next page\" tab is right next to one that says \"bookmark\nthis page\" - no information until you mouseover the tab to\ntell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmed\nwith glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and not\nenough information on your openning page.\n~~~~\n\nI also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URL\nending with .uk.  Recommendations for this site.\n1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to the\nanimation and red text on the yellow background, missing\nthe first sentence. Remove the animation and add more\ndetails to this important introduction. Instead of using the\n'click here' button, just have a text link following directly\nafter the introduction.\n2. On the second page, have all your links the same color,\nand all your text a different color. Don't confuse people on\nwhat is a link and what they need to read. Underlined text\non the internet can often be confused for a link, expecially\nwhen it is in the normal blue link color.  Having the\nimportant links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill.\n3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, but\nyou don't need the top menu bar when using the framed\nmenu and the pages are all untitled.\n\nI hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know you\nwant the best site you can have and I think these changes\nwill make a world of difference.  Once a person gets into the\nsite you have the information organized and complete. I\neven wanted to come and stay!\n~~~~\n\nThe animations make this site look amateurish from the\nbeginning.  The flashing \"Bookmark This Site\" makes me\nwant to leave instead of come back!  The font Comic Sans\nMS also looks very kiddy.  Much could be done to improve\nthis site.\n~~~~\n\nI was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on the\nfirst screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between\nthem. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't know\nwhere to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button should\nhave been up by the text and that is where I should go.\n\nOn the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs.  Other than that,\nthe 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. One\nsuggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to have\nthe menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of\nthe page as was shown on the 'special offers' page.\n\nThe font style and bright colors made the site look casual and\nlaid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good.\nBesides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, but\nif I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gotten\nthat far.\n~~~~\n\nThis site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to read\nand navigate. Logically presented and information-rich.\nSome pages had too many animated images for my own taste,\nbut the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a hold\nof PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares that\nform a background for some images.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n______________________________________________________\nmoderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\nposting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com\n______________________________________________________\n\nSend posts and questions (or your answers) to:\n   mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com\nPlease send suggestions and comments to:\n   mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\n\nTo change your subscribed address, send both new\nand old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\nSee below for unsubscribe instructions.\n\nCopyright 2001 AEOpublishing\n\n----- End of Your Membership Exchange\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis email has been sent to jm@netnoteinc.com at your \nrequest, by Your Membership Newsletter Services.\n\nVisit our Subscription Center to edit your interests or unsubscribe.\nhttp://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.jbozuta6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.com\n\nView our privacy policy: http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jsp\n\nPowered by \nConstant Contact(R)\nwww.constantcontact.com\n--1695567064.997091752024.JavaMail.RovAdmin.rovweb003\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\n\n<HTML>\n<!-- \n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML-FORMATTED MESSAGE BELOW\n\nThe remainder of this message is in HTML format for use by email\nclients that can properly display it.

It's very flashy and maybe\n<br>just a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way around\n<br>your site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gone\n<br>three pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful to\n<br>make your front page navigation a little less confusing?\n<p>The \"next page\" tab is right next to one that says \"bookmark\n<br>this page\" - no information until you mouseover the tab to\n<br>tell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmed\n<br>with glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and not\n<br>enough information on your openning page.\n<br>~~~~\n<p>I also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URL\n<br>ending with .uk.&nbsp; Recommendations for this site.\n<br>1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to the\n<br>animation and red text on the yellow background, missing\n<br>the first sentence. Remove the animation and add more\n<br>details to this important introduction. Instead of using the\n<br>'click here' button, just have a text link following directly\n<br>after the introduction.\n<br>2. On the second page, have all your links the same color,\n<br>and all your text a different color. Don't confuse people on\n<br>what is a link and what they need to read. Underlined text\n<br>on the internet can often be confused for a link, expecially\n<br>when it is in the normal blue link color.&nbsp; Having the\n<br>important links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill.\n<br>3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, but\n<br>you don't need the top menu bar when using the framed\n<br>menu and the pages are all untitled.\n<p>I hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know you\n<br>want the best site you can have and I think these changes\n<br>will make a world of difference.&nbsp; Once a person gets into the\n<br>site you have the information organized and complete. I\n<br>even wanted to come and stay!\n<br>~~~~\n<p>The animations make this site look amateurish from the\n<br>beginning.&nbsp; The flashing \"Bookmark This Site\" makes me\n<br>want to leave instead of come back!&nbsp; The font Comic Sans\n<br>MS also looks very kiddy.&nbsp; Much could be done to improve\n<br>this site.\n<br>~~~~\n<p>I was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on the\n<br>first screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between\n<br>them. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't know\n<br>where to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button should\n<br>have been up by the text and that is where I should go.\n<p>On the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs.&nbsp; Other than that,\n<br>the 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. One\n<br>suggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to have\n<br>the menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of\n<br>the page as was shown on the 'special offers' page.\n<p>The font style and bright colors made the site look casual and\n<br>laid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good.\n<br>Besides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, but\n<br>if I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gotten\n<br>that far.\n<br>~~~~\n<p>This site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to read\n<br>and navigate. Logically presented and information-rich.\n<br>Some pages had too many animated images for my own taste,\n<br>but the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a hold\n<br>of PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares that\n<br>form a background for some images.\n<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<br>______________________________________________________\n\t\t<p><br>moderator: Amy Mossel&nbsp; <a href=\"mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\">Moderator</a>\n<br>posting:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com\">MyInput@AEOpublishing.com</a>\n<br>______________________________________________________\n<p>Send posts and questions (or your answers) to:\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com\">MyInput@AEOpublishing.com</a>\n<br>Please send suggestions and comments to:\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\">Moderator@AEOpublishing.com</a>\n<p>To change your subscribed address, send both new\n<br>and old address to <a href=\"mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\">Moderator@AEOpublishing.com</a>\n<br>See below for unsubscribe instructions.\n<p>Copyright 2001 AEOpublishing\n<p>----- End of Your Membership Exchange\n\t\t<!-- End Letter Body -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<!-- Begin Signature  -->\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t<br>\n\t\t<hr width=\"60%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\" NOSHADE>\n\t\t<br>\n\t\t\n\n\t\t<!-- End Signature  -->\n\t\t</font>\n\t\t</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t</table>\n\t<!-- End Content Table -->\n\t</td>\n\t<td width=\"25\" bgcolor=\"#870000\">�</td>\n</tr>\n<!-- Begin Phone Number Row -->\n<tr>\n\t<td width=\"25\" bgcolor=\"#870000\">�</td>\n\t<td width=\"525\" bgcolor=\"#870000\" align=\"right\"><font face=\"Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\" size=\"1\" color=\"#FFFFFF\"> </font></td>\n\t<td width=\"25\"><img src=\"http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/images/letters/red-corner-br.gif\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"></td>\n</tr>\n<!-- End Phone Number Row -->\n<tr>\n\t<td colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" align=\"center\">\n\t<!--  You are required by your Constant Contact user agreement to\n      provide the opt-out link shown below as by the property 'OptOut' -->\n\n\t<font face=\"Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\" size=\"1\">\n\t<br>This email was sent to jm@netnoteinc.com, at your request, by <a href=\"http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/sa/s.jsp?id=bd7n7877.jbozuta6\">Your Membership Newsletter Services</a>.  \n\t<br>Visit our Subscription Center to <a href=\"http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.jbozuta6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.com\">edit</a> your interests or <a href=\"http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.jbozuta6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.com\">unsubscribe</a>.\n\t<br>View our <a href=\"http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jsp\">privacy policy</a>.\n\t<p>Powered by\n\t<br><a href=\"http://www.constantcontact.com/index.jsp?cc=ctrlr\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/images/cc-logo-color-sm.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Constant Contact\"></a>\n\t</font>\n\t<!-- end opt-out area -->\n\t</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n</center>\n</body>\n</html>\n--1695567064.997091752024.JavaMail.RovAdmin.rovweb003--\n\n\n\n"}
