Texas-based \nCommunicateNow.com, Inc. (OTC BB trading symbol: CMNW) may unlock \nChina's amazing potential.\n\nINVESTOR'S TIMING OPPORTUNITY\n\nTexas-based CommunicationsNow.com Inc. (OTCBB trading symbol: CMNW) \nannounces today that a top representative from CMNW will be traveling to \nChina in an attempt to negotiate with one of China's top manufacturers of\nhigh pressure laminate products for CMNW to act as a worldwide distributor\nof its products. You know what the Chinese did to the global steel market:\nthey captured it! China is now set to conquer another major commodity, and\nyou can profit right along with them. This is just one example of how CMNW \nmay make company history.\n\nOpening China's Door\n\nUsing hard-won experience gained in the survivor-takes-all US Internet market, \nCMNW developed technology that makes it possible for China's millions of \nentrepreneurs, small and medium sized companies, and major corporations to \ndo business worldwide via the Internet. Chinese makers of porcelain, for \nexample, can deal direct with US consumers and retailers. Say \"goodbye\" to \nthe layers of middlemen.\n\nCMNW strives to become a World Wide Wholesaler \n\nCMNW is attempting to become an International wholesaler to the world. This\nis an enormous goal. Many believe that trade with China built the world's greatest\nfortunes, from the golden age of Venice to the British Empire. Now this potential\nis being transferred to the Internet, and CMNW will attempt to capture it.\n\nCMNW puts all this into your portfolio: stability of a US-based company... \nsky-rocketing China market...convenience of a US-listed stock...dynamics of \na growth company. \n\n*** For the latest quarterly report on CMNW, go to www.freeedgar.com *** \n\nObviously, you cannot go back in time to the year 1901 and invest in baby US \ncompanies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson as they were getting started. \nBut you can grab the modern day equivalent. That's right. The growth \npotential in China at this very minute is like the United States at the start \nof the 20th century -- perhaps even greater. \n\nThere's much more to the CMNW story. Including a major expansion into Mexico. \n\nTo SUBSCRIBE to the future communications, please click on this link and hit send:\nmailto:abc111@uole.com.ve?subject=INFO-CMNW\n\n================================================================= \nPlease double click on the below link to be excluded from further communication. \nmailto:def222@uole.com.ve?subject=delete-CMNW \n=================================================================\n\nDISCLAIMER: Network Media Services provides an e-mail delivery service on behalf of securities \nissuers and publishers that circulate information about a company or the companyï¿½s securities. \nNetwork Media Services has received twenty thousand shares of the common stock of \nCommunicateNow.com, Inc.as payment to circulate this report via electronic mail to e-mail\naddresses contained in Network Media Services database.
