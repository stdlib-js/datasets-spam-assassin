I am wondering is \nthere a way to get access to these sites? -- <br>\n<p>\nA proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. \nI have had very good results with Surfola.

Also in the second or third \nparagraph is a misspelled word which should be \"first-come\" not as \nshown on the page.<p>\n\nI feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should \nbe displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered \non the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>\n\nAs has been mentioned many times, some information about the person \ndoing the page is always good.  We need some information about \nwhy this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nDennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations \nfor improving your page.<br>\n1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to \n'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading \nfor all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like \nyou were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>\n2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you \nto spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend \nlook it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>\n3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like \nbefore they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you \ntheir email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know \nthey can unsubscribe.<br>\n4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. \nIt looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>\n5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your \nnewsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or \nan archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>\n6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that \npage. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nI feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. \nI also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read \nquickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. \nI noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds \nsite should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. \nA site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nThis is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the \nmessage.  I did not like the background colour, however that is \npersonal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted \nto sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see \na current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word \nmissed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be \nsmaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*<br>\n\n~~~~<p>\n\nCould use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also \nare errors in the following paragraphs : \n\"first com-first serve\" and \"to place a sponsor advertisement, \nsend your to my email\"<br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nA single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's \nnewsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be \na way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to \nhave lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably \ndidn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be \nbetter served if he at least put some of the things out there for \nall to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to \nsubscribe. As it is, I would not bother.<br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nWhat does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful \nresources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy \nadvertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter \nwith the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) \nasking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. \nHe also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get \nfrom a site which has a grand title. Even the information about \nthe newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 \npoints size which gets difficult to read. <br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nA neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on \nthe eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its \njust an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an \nadvertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough \nmove perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter \nitself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of \nads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably \nyou'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting \nthe page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, \na privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click \nfor more info on your free ads. <p>\n________________________________________<br>\n\n<b>VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!</b><br>\n\nHelp out the winner of the free website redesign by voting for \nYOUR favorite!  <p>\n\nYou can help out Teddy at <a href=\"http://www.links4profit.com\"> links4profit.com</a> by taking a \nlook at his site, then checking out the three new layouts Jana of \nAkkaBay Designs <a href=\"http://AkkaBay.com\">AkkaBay.com</a> has designed specifically \nfor him.

To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.  <p>\n\nHow can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages \nwithout coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with \nactor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my \nfavorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. <p>\n\nMark <br>\nmoviebuff@cliffhanger.com <br>\n<p>\n\n\n\n<b>ANSWERS:</b><p>\n\nFrom: Zaak  - Zaako@linkpaks.com <br>\nSubject: Access using a proxy <p>\n\n>From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com) <br>\n>Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) <p>\n\n--> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is \nblocking 50% of \nthe web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by \nusing a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is \nthere a way to get access to these sites? -- <br>\n<p>\nA proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. \nI have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then \nfrom there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that \nblock content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money \nwith them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and \nbecause they allow me to surf anonymously! <p>\n\nI have a detailed right-up on them at <a href=\"http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php\"> http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php </a>\nSee there for more info.

Also in the second or third \nparagraph is a misspelled word which should be \"first-come\" not as \nshown on the page.<p>\n\nI feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should \nbe displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered \non the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>\n\nAs has been mentioned many times, some information about the person \ndoing the page is always good.  We need some information about \nwhy this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nDennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations \nfor improving your page.<br>\n1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to \n'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading \nfor all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like \nyou were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>\n2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you \nto spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend \nlook it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>\n3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like \nbefore they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you \ntheir email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know \nthey can unsubscribe.<br>\n4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. \nIt looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>\n5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your \nnewsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or \nan archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>\n6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that \npage. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nI feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. \nI also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read \nquickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. \nI noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds \nsite should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. \nA site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nThis is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the \nmessage.  I did not like the background colour, however that is \npersonal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted \nto sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see \na current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word \nmissed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be \nsmaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*<br>\n\n~~~~<p>\n\nCould use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also \nare errors in the following paragraphs : \n\"first com-first serve\" and \"to place a sponsor advertisement, \nsend your to my email\"<br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nA single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's \nnewsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be \na way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to \nhave lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably \ndidn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be \nbetter served if he at least put some of the things out there for \nall to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to \nsubscribe. As it is, I would not bother.<br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nWhat does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful \nresources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy \nadvertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter \nwith the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) \nasking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. \nHe also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get \nfrom a site which has a grand title. Even the information about \nthe newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 \npoints size which gets difficult to read. <br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nA neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on \nthe eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its \njust an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an \nadvertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough \nmove perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter \nitself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of \nads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably \nyou'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting \nthe page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, \na privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click \nfor more info on your free ads. <p>\n________________________________________<br>\n\n<b>VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!</b><br>\n\nHelp out the winner of the free website redesign by voting for \nYOUR favorite!  <p>\n\nYou can help out Teddy at <a href=\"http://www.links4profit.com\"> links4profit.com</a> by taking a \nlook at his site, then checking out the three new layouts Jana of \nAkkaBay Designs <a href=\"http://AkkaBay.com\">AkkaBay.com</a> has designed specifically \nfor him.
