I know how you feel\n- I print over 500 pages a day, and it feels like there is\na vacuum sucking money out of my wallet! Now, this has got\nto stop because I know it doesn't cost the printer companies\nanywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work!\nWell, it finally has.  The SUPERINK solution.\n\nYou're probably thinking to yourself, \"Gosh darn, not another\ncheap knockoff printer cartridge!\"� Like you, I was very \nskeptical at first, but my best friend & business associate\nsaid it helped her save over $100 a month on printer supplies. \nSo I tried it.� I mean, there was nothing to lose because they\noffer a 100% satisfaction guarantee, up to a one-year warranty\non all of their products and FREE Shipping on ALL orders!\nLet me tell you, it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\nPeriod.� Six months later, as I'm writing this message to you,\nI've gone from spending $1000 dollars a month on printer supplies\nto Now ONLY $475! and I haven't had to sacrifice the quality or\nservice that I received from the local office supply store. In fact,\nthe service is even BETTER!  I've had 1 defective cartridge since \nI started dealing with SUPERINK and they sent me a new replacement\nwithin 3 days, no questions asked. Now, I can print all I want!\n\nI was so happy with the results that I contacted their manufacturer\nand got permission to be a reseller - at a BIG discount.� I want\nto help other people to avoid getting jipped by the printer companies\nlike I did. Because a penny saved is a penny earned! \nI give you my personal pledge the SUPERINK soltuion will absolutely\nWORK FOR YOU. If it doesn't, you can return your order anytime\nfor a full refund.� � \n\nIf you are frustrated with dishing out money like it is water to the\nprinter companies, or tired of poor quality ink & toner cartridges,\nthen I recommend - the SUPERINK solution.\n\nYou're probably asking yourself, \"Ok, so how do we save all this money\nwithout losing quality and service?\"\n\nModern technology has provided SUPERINK with unique, revolutionary\nmethods of wax molding that allow the ink & toner to 'settle', which\nprevents any substantial damage that would occur during shipping and\nhandling.
