These spikes can damage sensitive electronics in computers\nto heavy industrial motors.\n\nFact:\tThese spikes or surges hit your electrical circuits up to 400,000\ntimes per hour.  Your electrical equipment is being gradually and\nsometimes suddenly destroyed.\n\nFact:\tOUR RANGE OF SURGE ARRESTORS will reduce your operating costs\ndramatically by extending the life of all your electrical and electronic\nequipment.\n\nMotors run cooler, your fluorescent lighting life is doubled.  Your\nequipment works more efficiently and your energy costs fall.\n\nFact:\tTHE SAVINGS you make in electrical consumption, electrical repairs,\nelectronic repair, telephone and data systems protection and lighting \nreplacements can cover the cost of installing our surge and lightning\narrestors.\n\nEven more importantly no sudden, dramatic system failure caused by\n\tlightning, surges and spikes.\n\nNow you know����!!\n\nDon't let your power supply kill your business!\n\nEmail me for more information. I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nMy very best to you.\n\nRay Butler  \nEmail: apec-tech@totalise.co.uk\n\nP.S.\tDon't underestimate the high level of risk and costs you're your\nbusiness is suffering from in replacement costs, down time and customer\ndissatisfaction.\n\nAPEC-TECH.COM\nThe Frieslawn Centre, Hodsoll Street, Sevenoaks, Kent.
