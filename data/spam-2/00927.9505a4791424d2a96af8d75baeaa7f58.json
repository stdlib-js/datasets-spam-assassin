To assist you with marketing your business on the \ninternet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing \ninformation which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find \nthousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to \nget this venture going:<BR><BR>METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL \nLEGALLY<BR>==========================================================<BR>Let's \nsay that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume \nYou and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that \nthe mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but \nlets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of \nthousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).<BR>Continuing with this example, \nyou send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders \nfor report # 1. <BR><BR>Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail \neach for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with \norders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.<BR><BR>Those 100 \npeople mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.<SPAN \nstyle=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </SPAN>The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders \nfor Report # 3.<BR><BR>Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total \nof 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for \nReport # 4.<BR><BR>Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total \nof 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders \nfor Report #5 <BR><BR>THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half \nmillion).<BR>Your total income in this example is: <BR>1..... $50 + 2..... $500 \n+ 3..... $5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000&nbsp; </P>\n<P class=MsoNormal>Grand Total=$555,550.00<BR><BR>NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A \nPENCIL &amp; PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW \nYOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY \n!<BR><BR>=========================================================<BR><BR>REMEMBER \nFRIENDS, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED \nTO.<SPAN style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </SPAN>Dare to think for a moment what \nwould happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 \ne-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet \nworldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and \nmore!<BR><BR>METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE \nINTERNET<BR>=======================================================<BR>Advertising \non the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to \nadvertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger \nresponse. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as \nyou go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the \nReport they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. \nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on \nit, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the \nreport.<BR><BR>=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================<BR>ORDER EACH \nREPORT BY ITS NUMBER &amp; NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) \nfor each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by \nwrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, \nWrite the NUMBER &amp; the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL \nADDRESS and your name and postal address.<BR><BR>PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE \nREPORTS NOW!!<BR>====================================================<BR \nstyle=\"mso-special-character: line-break\"><![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><BR \nstyle=\"mso-special-character: line-break\"><![endif]></P><SPAN \nstyle=\"FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\"><BR \nstyle=\"PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always\" clear=all></SPAN>\n<P class=MsoNormal><BR><B>REPORT # 1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for \nFree on the Net<BR></B><BR>Order Report #1 from:<BR>B.H.<BR>218 Timberwood<BR>Irvine, \nCal<SPAN style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </SPAN>92620</P>\n<P \nclass=MsoNormal>USA</P>\n<P class=MsoNormal><BR><SPAN \nstyle=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp;</SPAN>________________________________________________________<BR><B>REPORT \n# 2: The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk E-mail on the Net<BR></B><BR>Order \nReport # 2 from:<BR><SPAN style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp;</SPAN>J.B. \nErhart<BR>722 10th Street<BR>Paso Robles, CA. \n93446<BR>USA<BR>_________________________________________________________________<BR><B>REPORT \n# 3: Secrets to Multilevel Marketing on the Net<BR></B><BR>Order Report # 3 \nfrom:<BR>S.W.<BR>131 E.

My wife, Jody and I live in \nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good \nmoney. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk \nmail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spouting my knowledge of the population \nand percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my \nsupposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made \nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when \nthe thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had \nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ \n147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her \n''hobby''.<SPAN style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mitchell Wolf M.D., \nChicago, \nIllinois<BR><BR>======================================================<BR><BR>''Not \nbeing the gambling type, it took several weeks to make up my mind to participate \nin this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment \nwas so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at \nleast get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post \noffice box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The \nnice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There \nsimply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.\"<SPAN \nstyle=\"mso-spacerun: yes\">&nbsp; </SPAN>Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, \nCanada<BR><BR>=======================================================<BR><BR>''I \nhad received this program before.

Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another \ncopy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 \nmonths passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
