I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.\n2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. \nPlease,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.\n\nBest Regards, \n\nMr.David Kargbou and family. \n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
