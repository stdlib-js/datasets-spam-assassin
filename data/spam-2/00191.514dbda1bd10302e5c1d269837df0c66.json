Please explain\nhow safe and what your method involves.\n\nI have a time machine now, but it has limited abilitys and is \nuseless\nwithout\na vortex.\n\nIf you can provide information on how to create vortex generator \nor\nwhere I can get some of the blue glowing moon crystals this would \nalso\nbe helpful. I am however concerned with the high level of \nradiation these\ncrystals give off, if  you could provide a shielding that would be \ngreat.\nI believe the vortex needs to be east-west polarized,\nNorth-south polarized vortexexs are used for cross-dimensional \ntime \ntravel only.\n\n\nOnly if you have this technology and can help me exactly as \nmentioned\nplease send me a (SEPARATE) email to: IneedTimeTravel@aol.com\n\nPlease do not reply if your an evil alien!\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"}
