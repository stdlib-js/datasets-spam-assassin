It is from our 75 % we intend to import Agricultural machineries into my country as a way of recycling the fund.  \n\nTo commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number full name and address and your designated\nbank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.\n\nNote also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of its nature. \n \nI look forward to receiving your prompt response.\n \n \n \nMr. Kenneth Uba\n \nUnion Bank of Nigeria.\n \n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
