The number #1 problem with email lists are \ndeliverability. You may have seen dozens of ads for lists or CD's or you may have purchased a list in \nthe past. Chances are, the list was produced 6 months, 1 year or even two years ago! Not ours, a new \nvolume CD comes out every 6-7 weeks. \n\nHere's how we prepare our e-mail lists:\n\n1. We clean and eliminate all duplicates. \n\n2. Next, we use a filter list of 400+ words/phrases to clean even more. No address with inappropriate or \nprofane wording survive! \n\n3. Then, a special filter file is used to eliminate the \"Web Poisoned\" e-mail addresses from the list. Our\nEXCLUSIVE system reduced these \"poison\" addresses to near zero. You may have seen CD's with 30, 40, \n50 million addresses, not only do they contain many undeliverable addresses, but most are notorious for \nmillions of these \"poisoned\" email addresses.\n\n4. Next we used our private database of thousands of known \"extremists\" and kicked off every one we could \nfind. NOTE:We maintain the world's largest list of individuals and groups that are opposed to any kind of \ncommercial e-marketing... they are gone, nuked!\n\n5.
