I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank\nwith account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash\n[Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6,\n1997.\n\nSince the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched\nwith keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive\nas no one has come to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million\nfive hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my\nbranch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom\nhis name shall be used as the\nnext of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the\nbanking ethics here does not\nallow such money to stay more than five years, because money will be\nrecalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view\nof this I got your contact through a trade journal after realizing\nthat your name and country is similar to the deceased. I will give\nyou 25% of the total.\n\nUpon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail\nthe application, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will\nnot fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and\nthat you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund\ntransfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply\nto the bank as a relation to the deceased.\n\nWhen you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying\nYour decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick\ncommunication.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nObi   W.\n\n\n"}
