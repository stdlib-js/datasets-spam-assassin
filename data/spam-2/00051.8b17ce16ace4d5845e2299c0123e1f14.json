ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp; Really, they\n<br>can.&nbsp; But, it takes several very important components to\n<br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those necessities is a website.\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, your website does one of two things...\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.\n<p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do\n<br>not produce results.\n<p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.\n<br>Poor sales letters.\n<p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?\n<br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into\n<br>your sales letter...\n<p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.\n<br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your\n<br>sales letter to.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your\n<br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp; Write your sales letter\n<br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp; Why?\n<br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will\n<br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.\n<br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going\n<br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp; Keep your\n<br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is\n<br>going to read them.\n<p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp; In my\n<br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on\n<br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must\n<br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our\n<br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily\n<br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback\n<br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Leads have read of how\n<br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively\n<br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home\n<br>a solid message.&nbsp; Tell stories that illustrate a point you\n<br>are trying to make.&nbsp; Emphasize a benefit by sharing an\n<br>account from the \"real world.\"&nbsp; It effectively creates\n<br>interest and further establishes the point.\n<p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first\n<br>line.&nbsp; Your first line of the sales letter should\n<br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know\n<br>more.&nbsp; Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp; The first\n<br>words were, \"It's true.\"&nbsp; I can guarantee you that either\n<br>consciously or subconsciously you thought \"What's true?\"\n<br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking\n<br>about.&nbsp; Before you even knew it you were right here, 8\n<br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp; Carefully craft your first\n<br>line.&nbsp; If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,\n<br>you've got a winner.\n<p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted\n<br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use\n<br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or\n<br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.\n<br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight\n<br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.\n<p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp; Shortly after\n<br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet\n<br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp; Hit them with your best shot.\n<br>Pull out the big guns and stress \"just a few of\" the most\n<br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp; By offering a\n<br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically\n<br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad\n<br>copy.&nbsp; After all, if they are already interested after the\n<br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to\n<br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service\n<br>will aid them.\n<p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp; Write down everything that\n<br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You\n<br>can edit it later.&nbsp; If you just sit and start writing\n<br>everything you know about your product or service and how it\n<br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much\n<br>information floods your mind.&nbsp; Write it ALL down.&nbsp; Then read\n<br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to\n<br>many of the points.&nbsp; Edit it after you have exhausted all\n<br>of your ideas.\n<p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp; Make sure that the\n<br>words \"you\" and \"your\" are at least 4:1 over \"I\" and \"my.\"\n<br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not\n<br>yourself.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,\n<br>but it's something like this, \"I don't care a thing about\n<br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.\"&nbsp; Leads aren't\n<br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in\n<br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp; When you are finished\n<br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test\n<br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see\n<br>what the ratio between \"you\" and \"your\" versus references to\n<br>\"I,\" \"me,\" \"my,\" etc.&nbsp; It's a free service.&nbsp; Make sure it's\n<br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.\n<p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp; Forget all of those rules that\n<br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp; Write your sales letters\n<br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.\n<br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with \"And\" or \"Because.\"\n<br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.\n<br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great\n<br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest\n<br>Hemingway.\n<p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.\n<br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp; Use short\n<br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be\n<br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp; Like this one.\n<p>Or this.\n<p>See what I mean?&nbsp; Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of\n<br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often\n<br>force the reader to get distracted.\n<p>10)&nbsp; Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp; Again,\n<br>readers want the burning question answered, \"What's in it\n<br>for&nbsp; me?\"&nbsp; What need is it going to meet? What want is it\n<br>going to fill?&nbsp; How is your product or service going to be\n<br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp; Spell it out.&nbsp; Don't\n<br>focus on the features of your product or service , but\n<br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your\n<br>reader.\n<p>For example:&nbsp; If you are selling automobile tires, you may\n<br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,\n<br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I\n<br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while\n<br>we are traveling.&nbsp; So, instead of focusing on your selection,\n<br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe\n<br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not\n<br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress\n<br>the benefits, not the features.\n<p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp; Some sales letters read\n<br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can\n<br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are\n<br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to\n<br>understand.&nbsp; Unless you are writing to a very targeted\n<br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers\n<br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language\n<br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.\n<p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp; When you are finished with\n<br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a\n<br>specific audience.&nbsp; For example: If you are selling a \"work\n<br>at home\" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding\n<br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards\n<br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp; Then, rewrite the same sales\n<br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp; Write another\n<br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp; Still another could be\n<br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income\n<br>during summer vacation.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.\n<p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in\n<br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service\n<br>is specifically designed for a target audience. \"Work only\n<br>5 hours a week,\" would become \"College Students, work only\n<br>5 hours a week.\"&nbsp; Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload\n<br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website\n<br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).\n<p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted\n<br>mediums.&nbsp; You could advertise the \"College Students\" page\n<br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp; The \"Senior Citizens\" page could be\n<br>advertised at a retirement community message board.\n<p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally\n<br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product\n<br>to.&nbsp; And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a\n<br>match made for them.\n<p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp; Use short sentences\n<br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention\n<br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One\n<br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales\n<br>letters...\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is to use a pause like this.\n<p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting\n<br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,\n<br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on\n<br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook\n<br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. \"Let's\n<br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK\n<br>HERE to continue.\"\n<p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp; When the\n<br>customer purchases your product, they will generate \"a flood\n<br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.\"\n<br>If they do not order today, then they will \"feel like a cat\n<br>that let the mouse get away.\"&nbsp; Use words to create a picture\n<br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp; When you think of Superman, what\n<br>comes to mind?&nbsp; Immediately, we remember that he is \"faster\n<br>than a speeding bullet.\"&nbsp; \"More powerful than a locomotive.\"\n<br>\"Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.\" See how\n<br>word pictures stick in our minds?\n<p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp; Don't try to sell\n<br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only\n<br>confuses the reader.&nbsp; Keep your ad copy directed at one\n<br>specific product or service.&nbsp; Then, use other products and\n<br>services as back-end products.\n<p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself.&nbsp; There are\n<br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the\n<br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp; How will you stand out among the\n<br>crowd?&nbsp; Your sales letter must inject personality. It must\n<br>breathe of originality.&nbsp; Your product or service is\n<br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp; It is unique.\n<br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the\n<br>competition.&nbsp; It must create a feeling of \"You won't find\n<br>this anywhere else.\"\n<p>17) Be believable. \"Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!\"\n<br>Delete.&nbsp; Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or\n<br>something?&nbsp; Get real.&nbsp; Don't make outrageous claims that\n<br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp; You'll ruin your reputation.\n<br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be\n<br>reversed.&nbsp; Once you have been branded a liar, you will\n<br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you\n<br>launch the most respectable, honest business available\n<br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they\n<br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp; Be believable.\n<br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.\n<p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but\n<br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp; Instead of \"over 100 tips for losing\n<br>weight\" use \"124 tips for losing weight.\" By generalizing\n<br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's\n<br>mind.&nbsp; \"What am I really getting here?&nbsp; Does he even know?\"\n<br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to\n<br>think, \"This person must have counted.&nbsp; I know exactly what\n<br>I can expect.\"&nbsp; \"Platitudes and generalities roll off the\n<br>human understanding like water from a duck,\" wrote Claude\n<br>Hopkins in his classic book \"Scientific Advertising.\" \"They\n<br>leave no impression whatsoever.\"\n<p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would\n<br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp; Answer all of\n<br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before\n<br>making a purchase.&nbsp; Think about it from their point of view.\n<br>Ask yourself, \"Why wouldn't I buy this?\"&nbsp; Then, address that\n<br>in your sales letter.&nbsp; Remove anything that would keep the\n<br>reader from making the purchase.\n<p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp; Share actual\n<br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about\n<br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire\n<br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and\n<br>compliments listed.&nbsp; Satisfied customers remove some of the\n<br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp; \"If these people have\n<br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I\n<br>probably will too.\"&nbsp; Especially effective are testimonials\n<br>from respected, well known \"authorities\" within your target\n<br>field.\n<p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.\n<br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your\n<br>ad copy.&nbsp; Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp; A well-\n<br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings\n<br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next\n<br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on\n<br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp; They are\n<br>that important.\n<p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp; \"Wouldn't you like to\n<br>make $1,000,000 a year?\" \"Doesn't that sound great?\" \"Would\n<br>you like to be as successful as I am?\"&nbsp; Avoid any question\n<br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them\n<br>feel like they are inferior.\n<p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.\n<br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a\n<br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try\n<br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp; By offering a free\n<br>item, you can&nbsp; request their email address in order to\n<br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp; By doing this, you can now follow-up\n<br>with the customer for a potential future sale.\n<br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having\n<br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.\n<br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful\n<br>product or service which impresses the customer, they\n<br>probably will be back as a customer soon.\n<p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp; One of the things\n<br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters\n<br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product\n<br>I am offering.&nbsp; Ginsu made this one famous. They were\n<br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial\n<br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table\n<br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality\n<br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages\n<br>the credibility of your main offer.\n<p>25) Use connective phrases like \"But wait, there's more\"\n<br>and \"But that's not all.\"&nbsp; These phrases effectively lead\n<br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly\n<br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or\n<br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp; Again, the idea is MORE and MORE\n<br>value and benefits to the reader.\n<p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp; By including a deadline,\n<br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.\n<br>\"If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the\n<br>bonuses.\"&nbsp; \"Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,\n<br>I've got to hurry.\"&nbsp; Let the customer know what they will\n<br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,\n<br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will\n<br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines\n<br>are very effective.&nbsp; Every sales letter should have one.\n<p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp; Be clear as to the\n<br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp; Tell\n<br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,\n<br>etc.)&nbsp; Make this process as simple and clear as can be.\n<br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.\n<p>28)&nbsp; Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp; How\n<br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp; When will the order be\n<br>available?&nbsp; Let the customer know exactly what they can\n<br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp; The more specific you\n<br>can be here, the better.&nbsp; Let them know that you have a\n<br>system in place.&nbsp; \"Operators are standing by.\"&nbsp; Their order\n<br>will be handled properly.&nbsp; Tell them.\n<p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp; Take away their last\n<br>reason to hold back.&nbsp; Offer a \"no questions asked\" 30 day\n<br>guarantee.&nbsp; Most people may not realize this, but in most\n<br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp; You are REQUIRED to give\n<br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the\n<br>product or service.&nbsp; Since it's the law anyway, why not make\n<br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your\n<br>product or service RISK-FREE.\n<p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp; Many people\n<br>just need to read those words, \"Act Now!\"&nbsp; \"Order today!\"\n<br>\"Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.\"&nbsp; You've got them\n<br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp; Get them\n<br>to \"Act Fast!\"&nbsp; Have you ever heard a mail order commercial\n<br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right\n<br>way?\n<p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp; People will always read the\n<br>P.S.&nbsp; Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT\n<br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp; Because in many cases the\n<br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the\n<br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp; A\n<br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they\n<br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed\n<br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use\n<br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.\n<p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp; You better believe\n<br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp; Use\n<br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer\n<br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would\n<br>make them want to order.&nbsp; I guarantee you they will read it.\n<p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see\n<br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you\n<br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp; In fact, it would be\n<br>impossible for your responses to not improve.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p>Copyright 2000 Jimmy D.

ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp; Really, they\n<br>can.&nbsp; But, it takes several very important components to\n<br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those necessities is a website.\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, your website does one of two things...\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.\n<p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do\n<br>not produce results.\n<p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.\n<br>Poor sales letters.\n<p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?\n<br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into\n<br>your sales letter...\n<p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.\n<br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your\n<br>sales letter to.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your\n<br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp; Write your sales letter\n<br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp; Why?\n<br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will\n<br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.\n<br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going\n<br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp; Keep your\n<br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is\n<br>going to read them.\n<p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp; In my\n<br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on\n<br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must\n<br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our\n<br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily\n<br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback\n<br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Leads have read of how\n<br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively\n<br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home\n<br>a solid message.&nbsp; Tell stories that illustrate a point you\n<br>are trying to make.&nbsp; Emphasize a benefit by sharing an\n<br>account from the \"real world.\"&nbsp; It effectively creates\n<br>interest and further establishes the point.\n<p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first\n<br>line.&nbsp; Your first line of the sales letter should\n<br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know\n<br>more.&nbsp; Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp; The first\n<br>words were, \"It's true.\"&nbsp; I can guarantee you that either\n<br>consciously or subconsciously you thought \"What's true?\"\n<br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking\n<br>about.&nbsp; Before you even knew it you were right here, 8\n<br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp; Carefully craft your first\n<br>line.&nbsp; If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,\n<br>you've got a winner.\n<p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted\n<br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use\n<br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or\n<br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.\n<br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight\n<br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.\n<p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp; Shortly after\n<br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet\n<br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp; Hit them with your best shot.\n<br>Pull out the big guns and stress \"just a few of\" the most\n<br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp; By offering a\n<br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically\n<br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad\n<br>copy.&nbsp; After all, if they are already interested after the\n<br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to\n<br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service\n<br>will aid them.\n<p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp; Write down everything that\n<br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You\n<br>can edit it later.&nbsp; If you just sit and start writing\n<br>everything you know about your product or service and how it\n<br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much\n<br>information floods your mind.&nbsp; Write it ALL down.&nbsp; Then read\n<br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to\n<br>many of the points.&nbsp; Edit it after you have exhausted all\n<br>of your ideas.\n<p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp; Make sure that the\n<br>words \"you\" and \"your\" are at least 4:1 over \"I\" and \"my.\"\n<br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not\n<br>yourself.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,\n<br>but it's something like this, \"I don't care a thing about\n<br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.\"&nbsp; Leads aren't\n<br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in\n<br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp; When you are finished\n<br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test\n<br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see\n<br>what the ratio between \"you\" and \"your\" versus references to\n<br>\"I,\" \"me,\" \"my,\" etc.&nbsp; It's a free service.&nbsp; Make sure it's\n<br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.\n<p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp; Forget all of those rules that\n<br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp; Write your sales letters\n<br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.\n<br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with \"And\" or \"Because.\"\n<br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.\n<br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great\n<br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest\n<br>Hemingway.\n<p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.\n<br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp; Use short\n<br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be\n<br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp; Like this one.\n<p>Or this.\n<p>See what I mean?&nbsp; Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of\n<br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often\n<br>force the reader to get distracted.\n<p>10)&nbsp; Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp; Again,\n<br>readers want the burning question answered, \"What's in it\n<br>for&nbsp; me?\"&nbsp; What need is it going to meet? What want is it\n<br>going to fill?&nbsp; How is your product or service going to be\n<br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp; Spell it out.&nbsp; Don't\n<br>focus on the features of your product or service , but\n<br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your\n<br>reader.\n<p>For example:&nbsp; If you are selling automobile tires, you may\n<br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,\n<br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I\n<br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while\n<br>we are traveling.&nbsp; So, instead of focusing on your selection,\n<br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe\n<br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not\n<br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress\n<br>the benefits, not the features.\n<p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp; Some sales letters read\n<br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can\n<br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are\n<br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to\n<br>understand.&nbsp; Unless you are writing to a very targeted\n<br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers\n<br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language\n<br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.\n<p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp; When you are finished with\n<br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a\n<br>specific audience.&nbsp; For example: If you are selling a \"work\n<br>at home\" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding\n<br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards\n<br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp; Then, rewrite the same sales\n<br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp; Write another\n<br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp; Still another could be\n<br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income\n<br>during summer vacation.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.\n<p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in\n<br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service\n<br>is specifically designed for a target audience. \"Work only\n<br>5 hours a week,\" would become \"College Students, work only\n<br>5 hours a week.\"&nbsp; Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload\n<br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website\n<br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).\n<p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted\n<br>mediums.&nbsp; You could advertise the \"College Students\" page\n<br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp; The \"Senior Citizens\" page could be\n<br>advertised at a retirement community message board.\n<p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally\n<br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product\n<br>to.&nbsp; And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a\n<br>match made for them.\n<p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp; Use short sentences\n<br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention\n<br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One\n<br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales\n<br>letters...\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is to use a pause like this.\n<p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting\n<br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,\n<br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on\n<br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook\n<br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. \"Let's\n<br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK\n<br>HERE to continue.\"\n<p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp; When the\n<br>customer purchases your product, they will generate \"a flood\n<br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.\"\n<br>If they do not order today, then they will \"feel like a cat\n<br>that let the mouse get away.\"&nbsp; Use words to create a picture\n<br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp; When you think of Superman, what\n<br>comes to mind?&nbsp; Immediately, we remember that he is \"faster\n<br>than a speeding bullet.\"&nbsp; \"More powerful than a locomotive.\"\n<br>\"Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.\" See how\n<br>word pictures stick in our minds?\n<p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp; Don't try to sell\n<br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only\n<br>confuses the reader.&nbsp; Keep your ad copy directed at one\n<br>specific product or service.&nbsp; Then, use other products and\n<br>services as back-end products.\n<p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself.&nbsp; There are\n<br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the\n<br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp; How will you stand out among the\n<br>crowd?&nbsp; Your sales letter must inject personality. It must\n<br>breathe of originality.&nbsp; Your product or service is\n<br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp; It is unique.\n<br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the\n<br>competition.&nbsp; It must create a feeling of \"You won't find\n<br>this anywhere else.\"\n<p>17) Be believable. \"Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!\"\n<br>Delete.&nbsp; Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or\n<br>something?&nbsp; Get real.&nbsp; Don't make outrageous claims that\n<br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp; You'll ruin your reputation.\n<br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be\n<br>reversed.&nbsp; Once you have been branded a liar, you will\n<br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you\n<br>launch the most respectable, honest business available\n<br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they\n<br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp; Be believable.\n<br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.\n<p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but\n<br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp; Instead of \"over 100 tips for losing\n<br>weight\" use \"124 tips for losing weight.\" By generalizing\n<br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's\n<br>mind.&nbsp; \"What am I really getting here?&nbsp; Does he even know?\"\n<br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to\n<br>think, \"This person must have counted.&nbsp; I know exactly what\n<br>I can expect.\"&nbsp; \"Platitudes and generalities roll off the\n<br>human understanding like water from a duck,\" wrote Claude\n<br>Hopkins in his classic book \"Scientific Advertising.\" \"They\n<br>leave no impression whatsoever.\"\n<p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would\n<br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp; Answer all of\n<br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before\n<br>making a purchase.&nbsp; Think about it from their point of view.\n<br>Ask yourself, \"Why wouldn't I buy this?\"&nbsp; Then, address that\n<br>in your sales letter.&nbsp; Remove anything that would keep the\n<br>reader from making the purchase.\n<p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp; Share actual\n<br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about\n<br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire\n<br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and\n<br>compliments listed.&nbsp; Satisfied customers remove some of the\n<br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp; \"If these people have\n<br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I\n<br>probably will too.\"&nbsp; Especially effective are testimonials\n<br>from respected, well known \"authorities\" within your target\n<br>field.\n<p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.\n<br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your\n<br>ad copy.&nbsp; Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp; A well-\n<br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings\n<br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next\n<br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on\n<br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp; They are\n<br>that important.\n<p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp; \"Wouldn't you like to\n<br>make $1,000,000 a year?\" \"Doesn't that sound great?\" \"Would\n<br>you like to be as successful as I am?\"&nbsp; Avoid any question\n<br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them\n<br>feel like they are inferior.\n<p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.\n<br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a\n<br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try\n<br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp; By offering a free\n<br>item, you can&nbsp; request their email address in order to\n<br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp; By doing this, you can now follow-up\n<br>with the customer for a potential future sale.\n<br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having\n<br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.\n<br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful\n<br>product or service which impresses the customer, they\n<br>probably will be back as a customer soon.\n<p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp; One of the things\n<br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters\n<br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product\n<br>I am offering.&nbsp; Ginsu made this one famous. They were\n<br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial\n<br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table\n<br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality\n<br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages\n<br>the credibility of your main offer.\n<p>25) Use connective phrases like \"But wait, there's more\"\n<br>and \"But that's not all.\"&nbsp; These phrases effectively lead\n<br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly\n<br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or\n<br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp; Again, the idea is MORE and MORE\n<br>value and benefits to the reader.\n<p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp; By including a deadline,\n<br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.\n<br>\"If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the\n<br>bonuses.\"&nbsp; \"Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,\n<br>I've got to hurry.\"&nbsp; Let the customer know what they will\n<br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,\n<br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will\n<br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines\n<br>are very effective.&nbsp; Every sales letter should have one.\n<p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp; Be clear as to the\n<br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp; Tell\n<br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,\n<br>etc.)&nbsp; Make this process as simple and clear as can be.\n<br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.\n<p>28)&nbsp; Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp; How\n<br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp; When will the order be\n<br>available?&nbsp; Let the customer know exactly what they can\n<br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp; The more specific you\n<br>can be here, the better.&nbsp; Let them know that you have a\n<br>system in place.&nbsp; \"Operators are standing by.\"&nbsp; Their order\n<br>will be handled properly.&nbsp; Tell them.\n<p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp; Take away their last\n<br>reason to hold back.&nbsp; Offer a \"no questions asked\" 30 day\n<br>guarantee.&nbsp; Most people may not realize this, but in most\n<br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp; You are REQUIRED to give\n<br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the\n<br>product or service.&nbsp; Since it's the law anyway, why not make\n<br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your\n<br>product or service RISK-FREE.\n<p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp; Many people\n<br>just need to read those words, \"Act Now!\"&nbsp; \"Order today!\"\n<br>\"Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.\"&nbsp; You've got them\n<br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp; Get them\n<br>to \"Act Fast!\"&nbsp; Have you ever heard a mail order commercial\n<br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right\n<br>way?\n<p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp; People will always read the\n<br>P.S.&nbsp; Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT\n<br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp; Because in many cases the\n<br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the\n<br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp; A\n<br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they\n<br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed\n<br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use\n<br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.\n<p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp; You better believe\n<br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp; Use\n<br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer\n<br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would\n<br>make them want to order.&nbsp; I guarantee you they will read it.\n<p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see\n<br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you\n<br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp; In fact, it would be\n<br>impossible for your responses to not improve.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p>Copyright 2000 Jimmy D.
