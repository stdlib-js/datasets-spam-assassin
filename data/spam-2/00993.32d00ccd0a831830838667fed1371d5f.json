NO, there is no catch; just\nsend your e-mails and be on your way to financial freedom.\n\nBasically, I send out as many of these e-mails as I can, then\npeople send me CASH in the mail for information that I just e-mail\nback to them. Everyday, I make a three minute drive to my P.O. Box\nknowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for\nme.  And the best part, IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL.\n\nJust read the next few paragraphs and see what you think. If you\nlike what you read, great! If you don't, read it again because you\nmust have missed something.\n\n\"AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION\"\n\n\"Making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home\nfor an investment of only $25 US dollars expense ONE TIME.  THANKS\nTO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET, BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS\nWITHIN A YEAR!!!  Before you say, \"No Way!\" read the following.\nThis is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately.\nDue to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major\nnightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the\ninvestigation of the program described below to see if it really\ncan make people money.\n\nThe show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely\nno laws prohibiting the participation in this program. This has\nhelped to show people that this is a simple, harmless, and fun way\nto make some extra money at home.\n\nThe results of this show have been truly remarkable. So many\npeople are participating that those involved are doing much better\nthan ever before. Since everyone makes more as more people try it\nout, its been very exciting to be a part of it lately. You will\nunderstand once you experience it.\n\n\"HERE IT IS BELOW\"\n\n*** Print This Now For Future Reference ***\n\nThe following income opportunity is one you may be interested in\ntaking a look at. It can be started with VERY LITTLE investment\n($25) and the income return is TREMENDOUS!!!\n\nTHIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.\n\nIt does not require you to come into contact with people, do any\nhard work, and best of all, you never have to leave your house\nexcept to get the mail.\n\nSimply follow the instructions, and you really can make this\nhappen. This e-mail order marketing program works every time if\nyou put in the effort to make it work. E-mail is the sales tool of\nthe future.

Program\nyourself for success and dare to think BIG. It sounds corny, but\nit's true. You'll never make it big if you don't have this belief\nsystem in place.\n\nMULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It\nis being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford\nResearch and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50%\nand 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level\nmethods.\nThis is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000\nmillionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the\nlast several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45people\nbecome millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.\n\nYou may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an\nappearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he\nwould do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch.\nWithout hesitating Trump said he would find a good network\nmarketing company and get to work.\nThe audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the\naudience and dead-panned his response. \"That's why I'm sitting up\nhere and you are all sitting out there!\"\n\nWith network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct\ncommissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from\nsales made by people you introduce to the business.\n\nResidual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing\ntime and money once, and getting paid again and again and again.\nIn network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of\nothers.\n\nThe enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my\nfingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave\nsome thought and study to it.\n\nMy name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I\nworked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position\nwas eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to\nopen my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many\nunforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and\ncreditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my\nbusiness and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to\nrefinance and borrow against my home to support my family and\nstruggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened\nin my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that\nthis will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!\n\nIn mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's\nprior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for\ninformation on various business opportunities. All of the programs\nI received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were\neither too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial\ninvestment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work\nor not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one\nyear. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it!\n\nBut like I was saying, in December I received this program. I\ndidn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a\nmailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!\nAfter reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it\ncorrectly, I couldn't believe my eyes.\n\nHere was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON.\n\nI could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me\nfurther into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it\nout, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I\nwas still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal\naspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office\n(1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed\nlegal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN\nLETTER, I decided \"WHY NOT.\"\n\nInitially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my\ntime on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need\nany money for printing to send out the program, and because all of\nmy orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am\ntelling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I\npromised myself that I would not 'rip-off\" anyone, no matter how\nmuch money it cost me.\nHere is the basic version of what you need to do:\n\nYour first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1\nwithin 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND\nOUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.\n\nYour second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2\nwithin 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.\n\nOnce you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You\nwill make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off,\nkeep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build.\nKeep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted.\n\nIn less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT\n#1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13,\n1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making\n$50,000 in 90 days was done.\n\nBy January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more\nthan I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my\ne-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every\nday. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.\nPlease take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR\nLIFE FOREVER!!  Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This\nprogram does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the\nrules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It\nwon't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money!\n\nIn order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal\nof 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you\nwill make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first\ntwo goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of\nmoney, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out\nthe programs and stay focused! That's the key.  I AM LIVING PROOF\nTHAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program,\nI am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or\nrisk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and\nyou will be on your way to financial security.\n\nIf you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble\nlike I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this\na sign. I DID!  -Sincerely,  Jonathan Rourke\n\nP.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look\nlike piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!\n\nA PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:\n\nBy the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you\nshould have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal,\ncould not have been created by an amateur.\n\nLet me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business\nfor 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was\ndoing the same things that were previously successful for me, but\nit wasn't working.\n\nFinally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy.\nInflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had\nbeen with us since 1945.\n\nI don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment\nrate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There\nwere more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.\n\nThe middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were\ndoing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including\nthose who never had anything to save or invest were moving down\ninto the ranks of the poor.\n\nAs the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER.\"\nThe traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to\n\"move up\" or \"get rich\". Inflation will see to that.\n\nYou have just received information that can give you financial\nfreedom for the rest of your life, with \"NO RISK\" and \"JUST A\nLITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.\" You can make more money in the next few\nmonths than you have ever imagined.\n\nFollow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any\nway. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a\ncopy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of\nthe people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name\nwill be on everyone of them!\n\nRemember though, the more you send out the more potential\ncustomers you will reach.\n\nSo my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials\nand opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO\nYOU NOW!\n\n\"THINK ABOUT IT.\" Before you delete this program from your\nmailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY\nTHINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when\nYOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no\nmatter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!\nYou will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you\nhave will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody\nJacobs, Richmond, VA\n\nHERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$\n\nThis method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am\nsure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days.\n\nBefore you say \"No Way!\" please read this program carefully. This\nis not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making\nopportunity. Basically, this is what you do:  As with all\nmultilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new\npartners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows\nyou to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a\nproduct for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE\nFILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You\ndo it privately in your own home, store, or office.\n\nThis is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:\nThis is what you MUST do.\n\n1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell\nthem if you don't have them).\n\n* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE\nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME &\nRETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem).\n\n*MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF\nANY MAIL PROBLEMS!\n\n* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five\nreports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on\nyour computer and resell them.\n\n* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five\nreports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for\nyou to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.\n\n2. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed\nnext to each report, or their order\non the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps \"a\"\nthrough 'g\" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.\nOnce you understand the way this works you'll also see how it\ndoesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been\ntested, and if you alter it, it will not work.\n\na. Look below for the listing of available reports.\n\nb. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement\nand remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has\nmade it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!\n\nc. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.\n\nd. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.\n\ne. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3\n\nf. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.\n\ng. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position.\n\nPlease make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy\nand paste method works well,.\n\n3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names,\nand save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction\nportion of this letter.\n\nYour cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely\nyou can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet\nConnection and e-mail is FREE!\n\nTo assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5\nreports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing\ninformation which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find\nthousands of free classified ads and much, much more.\n\nHere are two primary methods of building your downline:\n\nMETHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL\n\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,\nand we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000\nprograms each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5%\nresponse. Using a good list, the response could be much better.\nAlso, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs\ninstead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out\nonly 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders\nfor REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000\nprograms each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people\nrespond and order REPORT #2.\n\nThose 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The\n0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000\nsend out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5%\nresponse to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to\n10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about\nlevel five!  That's $500,000 alone!\n\nYour total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000\n+ $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!!\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE\nYOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!\nDARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF\nSENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many\npeople will do just that and more!\n\nREPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and\ne-mail software.\n\nMETHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n\n1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are\nHUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to\nstart small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to\nget ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a\nlot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.\nAlso assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10\ndownline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING\nresults below:\n\n1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50\n2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500\n3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).......  $5,000\n4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) .......  $50,000\n5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......  $500,000\n\nTHIS TOTALS     -      $555,550\n\nRemember friends, this assumes that the people who participate\nonly recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen\nif they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of\nparticipants.\n\nTHINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is\ne-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE\nSAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the\ne-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be\nprompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!\n\nAVAILABLE REPORTS         *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND\nNAME ***\n\n* ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT\nACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make\nsure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets\nof paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT)  On one of\nthose sheets of paper include:\n(a) the number & name of the report you are ordering,\n(b) your e-mail address, and\n(c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider\nencounters problems).\n\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:\n\nREPORT #1 \"The Insiders Guide to Advertising for Free on the Internet\"\n\nORDER REPORT #1 FROM:\n\nTony Goon\n120 - 8511 Westminster Hwy.\nRichmond, BC.

Be prompt, professional, and follow\nthe directions accurately.\n\n* Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when\nthe orders start coming in.

By the\ntime you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your\nmailbox! For now, something simple, such as posting on message\nboards something to the effect of \"Would you like to know how to\nearn $50,000 working out of your house with NO initial investment?\nEmail me with the keywords \"more info\" to find out how. And, when\nthey email you, send them this report in response!\n\nIf you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,\ncontinue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.\n\nThen, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100\norders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending\ne-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders\nfor REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already\nworking for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!\n\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down\non the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can\nKEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are\nordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send\nanother batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the\nwhole process again! There is no limit to the income you will\ngenerate from this business!\n\nBefore you make your decision as to whether or not you participate\nin this program, answer one question ...\nDO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE?

My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I\nam a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make\npretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody\nabout receiving \"junk mail.\" I made fun of the whole thing,\nspouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.\nI 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed\nintelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of\nher, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the\nthing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks\nshe had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had\nreceived over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that\nI had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer\nnow. I have joined Jody in her \"hobby. \" I did have seven more\nyears until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's\nnot for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL.\n\nThe. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this\nsystem is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to\nget a large amount of money in a short time.

To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14\nweeks, with money still coming in.\n-Charles Morris, Esq.\n\nNot being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up\nmy mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I\ndecided that the initial investment was so little that there was\njust no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my\nmoney back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post\noffice box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded\nthat I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make\nmore money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice\nthing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live.\nThere simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.\n-Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA\n\nI had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I\nwondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no\nidea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I\nwas e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ...\nI didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the\nfirst try!!  -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA\n\nThis is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit\nour jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the\ninterest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will\nwork for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's\nsake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy\nspending!  -Kerry Ford, Centerport, NY\n\nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW!
