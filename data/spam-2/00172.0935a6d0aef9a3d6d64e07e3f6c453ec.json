I meant to contact http://taint.org webmaster,\nAm I correct, I hope?\n\nActually, I am not quite sure... Did I or Natasha Fedorova write \nyou before to your other address? Anyway, now I am here instead of \nher too.\n\nSo, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nI have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see, \npossibly you will find it interesting.\n\nPeople are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?\n\nThe thing is that I could get you in touch with developers from\nRussia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you for\nconsiderably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or \npay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - all\nprogramming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content\nwriting, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you may\naccept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and\ndevote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.\nAlternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more\nfeatures to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from\n$12, and an average of $18 an hour.\n\nI have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.html\n\nAs for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their\nspecialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.\nSo, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet \ndeadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant \nis online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also \ntheir company has local consultants in many states throughout the \nUSA, in Europe and Australia.\n\nSo, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?\n\nThank you very much,\nOksana Svetlova.\noksana@antee.com\n\nPS. Just in case you need any type of IT works now, please let me \nknow a bit of details, they will return you a cost/time estimation.\n"}
