How would you like \nto generate more income through a different avenue? What \nif it took only an hour to set it up? Even if you are already in another \nprogram, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. \nThere \nis NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!\n\nTHE FACTS ARE SIMPLE;- IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A FEW\nTHOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY FAST, THEN THIS PROGRAM I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH \nYOU \nIS THE WAY TO DO IT! IT'S THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!!\n\nHere's something which (I trust) will be of interest\nto you! Please read all of this. This is not something \nthat I would normally look at, except that I read an \narticle in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about \nPayPal and, when I came across this concept I knew it \nwould work because, as a member of Pay Pal, I had\nalready experienced their efficiency and good standing. \nYou can complete this whole process in one hour and you \nwill never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh! \nDid I say FAST? By fast I mean 'the speed of the \nInternet-type fast.' Everything is done on the\nInternet by E-mail.\n\nNEED PROOF? Here are just two testimonials from\nindividuals who decided to invest nothing more than a \nlittle of their time.\n\nTESTIMONIALS FROM:\n\nTony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA:\nHey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all of\nour frat brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 \ngrand yet, I'm up to $8,285. Hook me up when you run \nthis program again........\n\nMary Gathers, Columbia, SC:\nHey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to\nyou... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mail's out like you said \nand went on vacation. When I got back, my account was \nup to over $12,000! I owe you!\n\nGETTING STARTED.\n\nIf you're not already a user, the very first thing you\nneed to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two minutes \nand PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this \nprogram FREE!\n\nHere's the link:\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com\n\nBE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER (FREE) ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO \n$100 \nDOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!!\n\nThen...... E-mail $5.00 from your PayPal account ($5.00 free) \nto the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a little note\nlike \"Please add me to your mailing list.\" BE PREPARED TO GET\nEXCITED.... YOU \nWON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't laugh! Try this while you wait for the \nothers \nto start working. One hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. No \nprinting, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to US \nPostal and \nLottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, \nSection 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal \nRegulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a \nproduct or service must be exchanged for money received). \n\nHere's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this \nTHREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much\nfaster. Because it is so easy, the response rate is VERY \nHIGH, VERY FAST-Internet E-mail FAST-and you will see \nresults in just two weeks or less! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT \nMONTHS BILLS! You need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 \nor more as in other programs). Ideally, you should\nsend them to people who send their programs to you or to \npersonal contacts who are already working on the web, \nbecause they know these programs work and they are already \nbelievers in the system! Besides, this program is \nMUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already \nin \nanother program, stay with it, but do\nyourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! \n\nIt's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. It will pay off long \nbefore others even begin to receive letters! Just give ONE \nperson a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, this $5.00 is the $5.00 YOU GET \nWHEN \nYOU SIGN UP FOR YOUR new PayPal account). That's all! If you already have \na \nPayPal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 \nGIFT \nto\nthe person in the No.1 spot and add your name on the list \nat No.3 position having moved up the remaining two. Follow \nthe simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 \nin your bank account!\n\nBecause of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT \nPOTENTIAL, \nthis program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! All from just one $5.00 \ntransaction that you get from PayPal!!!\n\nFollow These Simple Instructions: \n\nE-mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST \nname on the list (No.1) along with a note saying \n\"subscribe me to your mailing list\". Only the first \nperson on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. \n\nEdit the list, removing the FIRST (No.1) NAME FROM THE LIST. Move the \nother \ntwo names UP and ADD YOUR NAME. Don't try to add your name in the first \nplace \nin order to earn money fast! \nIf you do that, you will ONLY reach people you send e-\nmail to then your name will be immediately removed\nfrom the No.1 place and you can't reach more people! But if \nyou add your name on the No.3 place, there will be tons of \npeople receiving e-mail's later and when your name is No.1!!! \n\nNOTE: Do not forget to replace the PayPal referring URL in \nthe body of the letter with your own PayPal referring URL. \nSend out 20 copies (minimum) of this letter.\n\nALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via E-MAIL, the \nresponse \ntime is much faster... ELECTRONIC TRANSFER INTERNET FAST! \n\nConsider this! Millions of people surf the Internet\neveryday, all day, all over the world! Here are the 3 people \nto start with. Sign up, send $5.00 to the first person, move \nthe other two up to Nos 1 & 2 respectively and add your own \ne-mail address at No.3. Be sure to use your email address that is \nassociated \nwith your PayPal account.\n\n*************************************\n\n1.  csreddy3@rediffmail.com\n\n2.  tomk4@prodigy.net\n\n3.  larryspaypal@yahoo.com \n\n*************************************\n\nThere are fifty thousand new people who get on the\nInternet every month! An excellent source ofemail addresses \nis the people who send you offers by email.\nThe source is UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to\nthink of all the possibilities! Mail, or should I \nsay 'E-mail', your letter and payment TODAY! It's \nso easy. One hour of your time, THAT'S IT!\nTo send your letter by e-mail, copy this ENTIRE PAGE\nand paste it in the message of your E-mail. \n\nTO DO THIS:\n1. Go in your toolbar to \"edit\" and \"select all\"\n2. Go in your toolbar to \"edit\" and select \"copy\"\n3. Start (compose) a new E-mail message (make sure\nit's PLAIN TEXT so everyone can view it!)\n4. Fill in your Address and Subject Box\n5. Go to \"edit\" and \"paste\" (Then you can format it\nanyway you want!)\n\n\nNow you can edit the addresses with ease. Delete the\ntop name, adding your name and address to the bottom \nof the list, then simply changing the numbers. Remember, \nYOUR NAME goes on the BOTTOM and the other 2 names move up. But DO NOT \nforget \nto send $5.00 via PayPal (along \nwith your note) to the position #1 - TOP E-MAIL\naddress before deleting it!\n\nNOTE: Be sure to replace the PayPal referring URL in\nthis e-mail of the letter with your own PayPal \nreferring URL;\n\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com\n\n\nTHERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.\nWhen your name reaches the first position in a few\ndays, it will be your turn to collect your MONEY!\nThe money will be sent to you by 2,000 to 4,000 people\nlike yourself, who are willing to invest one hour to \nreceive $20,000 in cash! That's all! There will be a \ntotal of $20,000 in $5.00 bills in your mailbox (account) \nin two weeks. $20,000 for one hour's work! This is \nreal money that you can spend on anything you wish!\nJust deposit it to your own bank account or spend it \ndirectly from your PayPal account!!! It's just that \neasy!!! I think it's WORTH IT, don't you?\n\nGO AHEAD--- TRY IT!!! EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4\nTHOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?\n\nIF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY! CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN? OF\nCOURSE YOU CAN---\n\nThis plan is structured for everyone to send only 20\nletters each. However, you are certainly not limited \nto 20. Mail out as many as you want. Every 20 letters \nyou send has a return of $20,000 or more. If you can \nE-MAIL forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT! \nTHE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT! Each time you run \nthis \nprogram, just follow steps 1\nthrough 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! \nSimple enough? You bet it is! Besides, there are no \nmailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the \nprinter or copier, and you can do it again and again \nwith your regular groups or gift givers, or start up \na new group. Be SURE and PAY the first person on the \nlist. This is proof that you paid to get put on the \nlist which is the service rendered to make all this \nlegal!!! Why not? It's working! Each time you receive \nan MLM offer, respond with this letter! Your name will \nclimb to the number one position at dizzying rates. \nFollow the simple instructions, and above all, PLEASE \nPLAY FAIR. That's the key to this program's success. \nYour name must run the full gamut on the list to produce \nthe end results. Sneaking your name higher up on the list \nWILL NOT produce the results you think, and it only cheats \nthe other people who have worked hard and have earned the \nright to be there. So please, play by the rules and the \n$$$ will come to you!\n$$$ E-MAIL YOUR LETTERS OUT TODAY! Together we will \nprosper! $$$ You are probably skeptical of this, \nespecially with all the different programs out there \non the web, but if you don't try this you will \nnever know. That's the way I felt. I'm glad I did it!\nI've been watching this type of program for years and\nthis is about as easy and fast as you can get it and \nit can even be free to try now with Pay Pal, no stamps, \nno envelopes, no copies to be made - just a little effort \nand faith!!! This program really \"Keeps It Short and Simple\"! \n\nOH BY THE WAY....each time someone signs up with your link \nunder your name... you also make $5.00 from PayPal...\nso they pay to open up the account but they also pay you when \nsomeone signs up from being referred by you.
