They are <b>Super-Fresh!</b>&nbsp; Delivered in Real-Time only <b>moments <br>\n</b>after they are contacted and qualified!&nbsp; (Not 30-120 days old)<br><br>\n3. They're <b>Targeted.</b>&nbsp; Each Lead we generate originates from a<br>\ntargeted list of business opportunity seekers.<br><br>\n4. They're <b>Highly Receptive!</b>&nbsp; <b>Receptivity is very, very high</b> <br>\nbecause they <b>aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching <br>\nthem on opportunities!</b>&nbsp; Also they'll remember speaking to <br>\nsomeone over the phone.&nbsp; Especially since <b>we tell them to <br>\nexpect your call!<br><br>\n</b>5. <b>No &quot;feast or famine&quot;</b> activity.&nbsp; Leads will be coming in <br>\nregularly.&nbsp; You dictate the flow!<br><br>\n6. <b>No more cold calls!&nbsp; </b>We tell your prospects you'll be calling.<br><br>\n7.

You can <b>sort your Leads</b> based on their responses and call the<br>\nhottest ones first.<br><br>\n11. You can <b>get new reps started quicker</b> using these Leads due <br>\nto <b>higher closing ratios</b>.&nbsp; Of course, this builds faster and stronger <br>\nmomentum, and skyrockets &quot;new rep retention&quot; as a result of <br>\n&quot;quick successes&quot;.<br><br>\n12. The <b>Leads will be uniform </b>- almost all leads will have the info. <br>\nindicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)<br><br>\n13.
