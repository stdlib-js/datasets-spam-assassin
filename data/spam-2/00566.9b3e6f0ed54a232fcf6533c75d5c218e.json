Six months back my shoe company was going bankrupt in a time of one month. I have no where to turn to. Luckily I met this guy Michael at www.blessing-people.com This is a non-profit web site. He really saved me. He started to chant for mine business without asking for any money when I told him my story. In just 10 days my business turn around. At the end of the month I could pay my monthly loan instalment. Thing steadily stabilized. Immediately I subscribe to his chanting servies. Those money Michael collected are for donation later in every year. I know I must have been creating good karma by subscribing to his prayers services. Now I am hunting for my second shop. Thanks to Michael.\n\nI do not have any connection to him. I am just spreading this good karma just to repay what he had did for me. I deeply know what ever he did it's a miracle to me. Even until today all I know was Michael chant for me & many people.. And many miracle happened.\n\nI am sorry if this email annoy you. I am not promoting Michael or my business this email can be clearly seen.\n\nPlease help spread this good karma around. Direct people to Michael. Creat good karma today for you future!\n\n\n\nTan E.G.\n\n@pls: Click www.blessing-people.com    Go there to feel his energy!!\n\n\n"}
