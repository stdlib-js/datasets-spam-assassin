This is by virtue of its nature\nas being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and �TOP SECRET.� \nThough I know that a transaction of this magnitude\nwill make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am\nassuring you that all will be well at the end of the\nday. \n\nWe have decided to contact you first by your email due\nto the urgency of this transaction, as we have been\nreliably informed that it will take at least two to\nthree weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we\ndecided it is best using the email. \n\nLet me start by first introducing myself properly to\nyou. I am Dr. Osaro Ame, a director general in the\nMinistry of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man\ntender board appointed by the Government of the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria to award contracts to\nindividuals and companies and to approve such contract\npayments in the Ministry of Mines and Power. The\nduties of the committee also include evaluation,\nvetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign\nand local contractors in the ministry.\n\nI came to know of you in my search for a reliable and\nreputable person to handle a very confidential\nbusiness transaction which involves the transfer of a\nhuge sum of money to a foreign account requiring\nmaximum confidence. In order to commence this\nbusiness, we solicit for your assistance to enable us\ntransfer into your account the said funds. \n\nThe source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996\nand 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various\ncontractors for engineering, procurement, supply of\nelectrical equipments such as Transformers, and some\nrural electrification projects. \n\nHowever, these contracts were over-invoiced by the\ncommittee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million\ndollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United\nStates Dollars) in excess. This was done with the\nintention that the committee will share the excess\nwhen the payments are approved. \n\nThe Federal Government have since approved the total\ncontract sum which has been paid out to the companies\nand contractors concerned which executed the\ncontracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,\nwhich we need your assistance to transfer into a safe\noff-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst\nourselves.\n\nWe need your assistance as the funds are presently\nsecured in an escrow account of the Federal Government\nspecifically set aside for the settlement of\noutstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are\nhandicapped in this circumstances as the civil service\ncode of conduct, does not allow us to operate\noff-shore accounts, hence your importance in the whole\ntransaction is highly needed . \n\nMy colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your\ncompany can act as the beneficiary of this funds on\nour behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the\ntotal amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five\nHundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%\nwill be for us (members of this panel) and the\nremaining 10% will be used in offsetting all\ndebts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in\nthe cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust\nreposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return\nwe demand your complete honesty and trust. \n\nIt does not matter whether or not your company does\ncontract projects of this nature described here, the\nassumption is that your company won the major contract\nand sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More\noften than not, big trading companies or firms of\nunrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract\nto more specialized firms for execution of such\ncontracts. We are civil servants and we will not\nwant to miss this once in a life time opportunity.\n\nYou must however, NOTE that this transaction will be\nstrictly based on the following terms and conditions\nas we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed\ncases of business associates running away with funds\nkept in their custody when it finally arrive their\naccounts. We have decided that this transaction will\nbe based completely on the following: \n\n(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and\ndiligence. \n\n(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost\nsecrecy and confidentiality. \n\n(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly\nrelease our share (70%) on demand after you have\nremoved your 20% and all expenses have been settled. \n\n(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough\ninformation about yourself to put our minds at rest. \n\nPlease, note that this transaction is 100% legal and\nrisk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten\nBank working days from the date of receipt of the\nnecessary information and requirement from you. \n\nEndeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter\nusing my email fax number 1-443-658-2542 or my email\naddress and I will bring you into the complete picture\nof this transaction when I have heard from you. \n\nYour urgent response will be highly appreciated as we\nare already behind schedule for this financial\nquarter. \n\nThank you and God bless. \n\nYours faithfully, \n\nDr. Osaro Ame \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
