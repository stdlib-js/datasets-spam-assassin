REGINA ROSSMAN.\n#263 SANDTON CITY\nJOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.\nE-MAIL: joel_rose1@mail.com\n\n\nATTN:ALHAJI\n\nWith due respect, trust and humility, I write you this\nproposal, which I believe, would be of great interest\nto you. I am Mrs. regina Rossman, the wife of late Mr.\nJoseph Rossman of blessed memory, before forces loyal\nto\nMajor Johnny Paul Koromah killed my husband; he was\nthe Director General of Gold and Mining Corporation\n(G.D.M.C.) of Sierra Leone. My husband was one of the\npeople targeted by the rebel forces. On the course of\nthe revolution in the country, prominent people were\nhijacked from their homes to an unknown destination.\n\nTwo days before his death, he managed to sneak a\nwritten message to us, explaining his condition and\nconcerning one trunk box of valuables containing\nmoney, which he concealed under the roof. He\ninstructed me to take our son and move out of Sierra\nLeone, immediately to any neighboring country. The\npowerful peace keeping force of the �(ECOMOG)�\nintervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by\nthe rebels, which was the order of the day.\nEventually, it resulted into full war, I became a\nwidow overnight, helpless situation, without a partner\nat the moment of calamity, and every person was\nrunning for his life. My son and I managed to escape\nto South Africa safely with the box and some documents\nof property title.\n\nThe cash involved inside the box was US$30 Million\n(Thirty Million United States Dollars). Due to fear\nand limited rights as a refugee, I deposited the items\nwith a private security company in order not to raise\nan eyebrow over the box here in South Africa in my\nson�s name JOEL R. ROSSMAN. Be informed that the real\ncontent of the box was not disclosed. Meanwhile, I\nwant to travel out of South Africa entirely with this\nmoney for investment in your country because of\npolitical and economic stability and for future\nbenefit of my child.\n\n\nI want you to assist us claim this box from the\nsecurity company and get the money into your private\naccount in your country so that we can invest the\nmoney wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding\ninvestment and good relationship with you.\n\n\nConcerning the money, we are prepared to give you\nreasonable percentage of 30% for your kind assistance.\nAlso, we have decided to set aside 5% of the total sum\nfor expenses that might be incurred by the parties in\nthe course of the transfer both locally and\nexternally. For the interest of this business, do not\nhesitate to contact my son Mr. JOEL R. ROSSMAN on the\nabove e-mail address immediately you\nreceive this message for more information and to\nenable\nus proceed towards concluding all our arrangements. No\nother person knows about this money apart from my son\nand I. We await your most urgent response.please we\nneed your fax/phone numbers for esiear communication.\n\nThanking you for your co-operation and God bless you.\n\n\nBest regard,\n\nMRS. REGINA ROSSMAN.\n\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
