B. Sanni, a close confidant to Mohammed Abacha, son of late\nGeneral Sani Abacha, former head of state Federal Republic of Nigeria, who\nruled from November 17th 1993 to June 8th 1998 when he died suddenly in\noffice.\n\nSince then, the family as a whole has been facing all sorts of\nharassments, by security operatives/agents of the new Head of State\n(General Obasanjo) who served a jail term under my friend's father for\ncoup offence. Even my friend's old mother has been detained and tortured\nmany times.  Mohammed is now being charged for military decision of his\nfather's regime e.g. the murder cases of political opponents. These\noffences he knows nothing about, as he was only the Head of State's son,\nnot even a military man nor was he in the government. \n\nHis father ruled for five years during which period he acquired financial\ngains and property all over the world from his share of Crude Oil Sales as\nthe Head of State. Now, the family has lost all assets (property and money\nin Nigeria) to the new government. Ref. News Watch Magazine publication of\n11th to 18th October, 1999. However, they have hidden records in a secret\nname with the Nigerian Insurance Deposit Corporation to access a coded\ntrust accounts in Europe valued at Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million\nUnited States Dollars only ($338,000,000).   Mohammed is currently being\ndetained and tortured to sign off accounts of his late father and he has\ndone that but not the coded trust accounts in the name of certain\ngovernment multinational contractors that I can not disclose now.\n\nTHE AIM OF THIS LETTER IS TO REQUEST YOUR ASSISTANCE TO SECURE THIS\nACCOUNT IN A SAFE/CONFIDENTIAL BANK AND HELP INVEST THE MONEY FOR OUR\nMUTUAL BENEFIT. We also expect to use some of our share of the money to\nrelocate ourselves to another safe Country because right now Nigeria is\nnot safe and we will like to go into hiding overseas if we can escape.\n\nIf you are interested in helping secure the accounts please contact me\nimmediately by email \"a_sanni@email.com\", so that we can arrange an\ninitial meeting in a neighboring country, thus you can present your\ninvestment program and projects for our assessment.  Thereafter we will\nsign an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) binding this business\nrelationship and immediately entrust you to access the coded trust\naccounts in Europe valued at Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million United\nStates Dollars only ($338,000,000).\n\nWe will depend on your business experience to make sure that we get\nmaximum returns on our investment with you.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT IN THE PROCESS OF SECURING THE CODED TRUST ACCOUNT YOU\nARE LIKELY TO INCURE EXPENSES BUT IT WILL BE PAID BACK ONCE WE SECURE THE\nDEPOSIT.  IT IS 100% SAFE FOR YOU AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. \nJust forward via email your full name, phone number, fax number and bank\ndetails as the new beneficiary to enable us make formal application for\nthe transfer of ownership to you.\n\nWe look forward to your helping us, but if you are not interested kindly\ndiscard this letter and still maintain its confidentiality.\n\nMa-Salam.\n\nFor Mohammed Abacha\n\n"}
