What you do to \n <BR>become successful in the online world is not a \"secret\", \n <BR>in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, \n <BR>repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the \n <BR>Net or off.\n <BR>\n <BR>But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, \n <BR>consultation, or simply asking, \"What's your secret?\", \n <BR>I have to blush & say ...\n <BR>\n <BR>Persistence and personality.\n <BR>\n <BR>Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little \n <BR>disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the \n <BR>same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over \n <BR>the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  \n <BR>my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.\n <BR>\n <BR>Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. \n <BR>It's not years of digging to find the \"secrets\" to internet riches.\n <BR>\n <BR>One thing that \"gets to me\" so often in my work as an \n <BR>Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success \n <BR>Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to \n <BR>have this incredibly huge mental block that stands \n <BR>between themselves and success on the Net. It's \n <BR>almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims \n <BR>of what works and what doesn't work, and so many \n <BR>LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in \n <BR>their online venture, that \"success\" is the  <BR>equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.\n <BR>\n <BR>It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!\n <BR>\n <BR>Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau \n <BR>has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking \n<BR>the Bank. Get it!! \n <BR><a href=\"http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb\">http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb</a> . \n <BR>But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks \n <BR>so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your \n <BR>online venture a success. \n <BR>\n <BR>And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of \n <BR>\"self marketing\" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's \n <BR>the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't \n <BR>agree with him more.\n <BR>\n <BR>Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to \n <BR>succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your \n <BR>marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' \n <BR>experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! \n <BR>Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.\n <BR>\n <BR>The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have \n <BR>standing high as you can see, blocking the path \n <BR>between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is \n <BR>not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there \n <BR>to fear to begin with ... get over it!!\n <BR>\n <BR>What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between \n <BR>you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. \n <BR>When you realize this, you will tear down that brick \n <BR>wall by means of complete and instantaneous \n <BR>disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, \n <BR>which is the only \"real\" place it ever was anyhow!\n <BR>\n <BR>Yes, \"persistence and personality\" inherently includes \n <BR>honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other \n <BR>qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate \n <BR>goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  \n <BR>powerful key to your success ... is YOU!\n <BR>\n <BR>That may be the most incredible \"secret\" we ever \n <BR>uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall \n <BR>won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.\n <BR>\n <BR>Talk about SIMPLE!!\n <BR>\n <BR>------------------------------------------------------\n <BR>Bryan is a \"veteran\"  Internet  Consultant, Author, \n <BR>Internet Success Strategist & Marketer.

What you do to \n <BR>become successful in the online world is not a \"secret\", \n <BR>in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, \n <BR>repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the \n <BR>Net or off.\n <BR>\n <BR>But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, \n <BR>consultation, or simply asking, \"What's your secret?\", \n <BR>I have to blush & say ...\n <BR>\n <BR>Persistence and personality.\n <BR>\n <BR>Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little \n <BR>disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the \n <BR>same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over \n <BR>the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  \n <BR>my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.\n <BR>\n <BR>Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. \n <BR>It's not years of digging to find the \"secrets\" to internet riches.\n <BR>\n <BR>One thing that \"gets to me\" so often in my work as an \n <BR>Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success \n <BR>Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to \n <BR>have this incredibly huge mental block that stands \n <BR>between themselves and success on the Net. It's \n <BR>almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims \n <BR>of what works and what doesn't work, and so many \n <BR>LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in \n <BR>their online venture, that \"success\" is the  <BR>equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.\n <BR>\n <BR>It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!\n <BR>\n <BR>Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau \n <BR>has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking \n<BR>the Bank. Get it!! \n <BR><a href=\"http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb\">http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb</a> . \n <BR>But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks \n <BR>so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your \n <BR>online venture a success. \n <BR>\n <BR>And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of \n <BR>\"self marketing\" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's \n <BR>the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't \n <BR>agree with him more.\n <BR>\n <BR>Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to \n <BR>succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your \n <BR>marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' \n <BR>experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! \n <BR>Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.\n <BR>\n <BR>The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have \n <BR>standing high as you can see, blocking the path \n <BR>between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is \n <BR>not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there \n <BR>to fear to begin with ... get over it!!\n <BR>\n <BR>What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between \n <BR>you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. \n <BR>When you realize this, you will tear down that brick \n <BR>wall by means of complete and instantaneous \n <BR>disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, \n <BR>which is the only \"real\" place it ever was anyhow!\n <BR>\n <BR>Yes, \"persistence and personality\" inherently includes \n <BR>honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other \n <BR>qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate \n <BR>goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  \n <BR>powerful key to your success ... is YOU!\n <BR>\n <BR>That may be the most incredible \"secret\" we ever \n <BR>uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall \n <BR>won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.\n <BR>\n <BR>Talk about SIMPLE!!\n <BR>\n <BR>------------------------------------------------------\n <BR>Bryan is a \"veteran\"  Internet  Consultant, Author, \n <BR>Internet Success Strategist & Marketer.
