This is one of those. Why?\n\nBecause interest rates are definitely rising.\n\nHave you locked in the lowest rate (in THREE\nDECADES yet!) for your present mortgage?\n\nRates haven't been this low in almost 3 decades.\nThey may well never be this low again--ever. If\nyou haven't taken this opportunity to secure the\nbest possible rate on your home loan, you're\nsimply letting money slip through your fingers.\n\nAt a few special times, it is SO easy to save\n\"big bucks\"...and this is one of those times. Why\ncontinue to pay more than is necessary and\ncontinue to let future savings slip away?\n  \nWe're a national mortgage provider. We're NOT a\nbroker. As such, we can guarantee you the lowest\npossible rate and the best possible deal but only\nif you act NOW.\n \nThere is no charge, cost or obligation to see if\nthis opportunity meets your needs. You can easily\ndetermine if a new loan makes sense for you, and\nexactly why, because we provide only \"easy to\nunderstand\" quotes (in \"layman's terms\", in other\nwords).\n \nWe offer primary and secondary home loans and we\nwill be happy to show you in \"black and white\"\nwhy your existing loan is the best for you or why\nyou should replace it. Of course, there's no cost\nto you at all to share your time with us. None. \n\nTake 2 minutes and use the link below that works\nbest for you. For 2 minutes of your time, we'll\nshow you how you can save you and your family\n\"big bucks\" today. This is a once-every-30-years\nopportunity. So don't delay and \"miss the boat\".\nAct now.\n\n<a href=\"http://gd11.doubleclick.net/click;3518383;15-0;0;6177677;1-468|60;0|0|0;;http://61.129.81.99/paul/bren/mortg/\">Click_Here</a>\n\nhttp://gd11.doubleclick.net/click;3518383;15-0;0;6177677;1-468|60;0|0|0;;http://61.129.81.99/paul/bren/mortg/\n \nSincerely,\n\nMark.
