PLEASE READ THIS ALL!!!!!!!!! <BR>!!!! NOT A SCAM!!!! =\n<BR>!!! I REPEAT NOT A SCAM!!! <BR>THIS ONLY COST YOU 6.00 CASH!!! =\nINVESTMENT!!! IT DOES WORK!!! <BR>I found this on a bulletin board and =\ndecided to try it. A little while back, I was browsing through =\nnewsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to =\nthis that said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with =\nonly an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought, Yeah right, this must =\nbe a scam\", but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. =\nAnyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address =\nstated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the =\nbottom of the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 =\nnewsgroups. (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after =\nthinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about =\ntrying it. I figured: \"what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and =\n$6.00, right?\" Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!?... =\nWithin 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I =\nfigured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my =\nfirst week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had =\nmade a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over $10,000.00 =\nand it's still growing. This is how my fourth week and I have made a =\ntotal of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's =\ncertainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on the =\nlottery!!(This is not me but i am&nbsp;also making alot of =\nmoney)&nbsp;<BR><BR>Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, =\nWHY it works... Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so =\nyou can get the information off of it, as you need it. I promise you =\nthat if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making =\nmore money than you thought possible by doing something so easy! =\nSuggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (Print it out or =\ndownload it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the as money comes =\nin! It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus =\npostage) <BR><BR>IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; =\nit is not illegal; and it is 99% no risk - it really works! If all of =\nthe following instructions are adhered to, you will receive =\n<BR>extraordinary dividends. <BR><BR>PLEASE NOTE: <BR>Please follow =\nthese directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 =\ndays. This program remains successful because of the honesty and =\nintegrity of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully =\nadhering to the instructions. You will be part of the Mail Order =\nbusiness. In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it's =\na service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many =\nlarge corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. =\nHowever, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the =\nincome, which is made from people like you and me asking to be included =\nin that list. Here are the 4 easy steps to success: <BR><BR>STEP 1: Get =\n6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on <BR>each piece of =\npaper \"PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.\" Now <BR>get 6 US $1.00 bills =\nand place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not =\nbe seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one =\npaper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 =\nsealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, =\nyour name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating =\na service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate =\nservice and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little =\nskeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I =\nchecked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they =\nconfirmed that it is indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following =\naddresses: <BR><BR>#1) Mike Gordon, 204 South Maple St., Winchester, =\nKY.40391 <BR>#2) Jeff Waldrop, 39-A Lucy Rd., Laurel, MS 39443 <BR>#3) =\nBrian Thompson, 15 Briggs Pond WY. Sharon, MA 02067 <BR>#4) A. Guy , =\n6127 Seabree LN, ,Ft. Wayne, In 46835 <BR>#5) Wes Armstrong, 157 =\nButternut Rd., Shavertown, PA 18708 <BR>#6) Trista Friend, P.O. Box =\n1265, Long Beach, WA 98631 <BR><BR>STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the =\nlist that you see above, move <BR>the other names up 1 place (#2 becomes =\n#1, #3 becomes #2, etc.) and add YOUR name and address as number 6 on =\nthe list. <BR><BR>STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep =\nthis article as <BR>close to original as possible. Now, post your =\namended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to =\n24,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the =\nmore money you make! You won't get very much unless you post like crazy. =\nThis is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to <BR>Title 18 =\nSec. 1302 &amp; 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these =\nsteps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, =\nand again. <BR><BR>PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful =\nbecause of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their =\ncarefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of =\nintegrity, the program will continue and the money that so many =\n<BR>others have received will come your way. <BR>NOTE: You may want to =\nretain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard =\ncopy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are =\ntruly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 =\nbill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post =\nis downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six members will be =\nreimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar =\neach. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your =\nname reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars =\nin CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the =\nfirst six people listed above) Send it now, and add your own name to the =\nlist and you're in business! <BR><BR>-----DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO =\nPOST TO NEWSGROUPS-------------- <BR>Step 1) You do not need to re-type =\nthis entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the =\nbeginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this =\ndocument, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the =\nentire letter into the computer's memory. <BR><BR>Step 2) Open a blank =\n'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From =\nthe 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter =\ninto notepad so that <BR>you can add your name to the list. <BR><BR>Step =\n3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your =\npostings in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back =\nto. <BR><BR>Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching =\nfor various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, =\ndiscussions.) <BR><BR>Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this =\narticle as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and =\nselecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will =\n<BR>be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of =\npostings in a particular group, click the post message button. You're =\ndone with your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to =\ndo is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang =\nof it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! =\n<BR><BR>**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU =\nWILL MAKE! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** <BR><BR>that's it! =\nYou will begin receiving money from around the world within days! You =\nmay <BR>eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large amount of =\nmail you will receive. If <BR>you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent =\na name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE =\nALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT. ** <BR><BR>Now, each of the 5 persons who =\njust sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at =\n#5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another =\n$25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at =\n#4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00! Now, =\nthose 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at =\n#3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $625.00! =\nOK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM =\n200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 <BR>replies, =\nthat just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this =\nmessage to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per =\n200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original =\ninvestment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the =\nlist, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out =\nanother $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. =\nAnd start posting again. Do you TURN 6 (six) DOLLARS INTO $6000 or even =\n$60000 EASY AND HONESTLY!!! <BR><BR>The thing to remember is: do you =\nrealize that thousands of people all <BR>over the world are joining the =\nInternet and reading these articles everyday? JUST LIKE YOU are now!! =\nSo, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... =\nPeople have said, \"what if the plan is played out and no one sends you =\nthe money?\" So what!
