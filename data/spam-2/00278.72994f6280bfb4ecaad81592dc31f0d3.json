ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE\nAND THE INTERNET!\n\nThis is the letter you have been hearing a lot about recently.\nDue to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national\nweekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the\ninvestigation of this program described below, to see if it really\ncan make people money.\n\nThis is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable \nopportunity. I was approached many times before but each time \nI passed on it.  I am so glad I finally joined just to see what \none could expect in return for the minimal effort and money \nrequired.  To my astonishment, I received a 6 figure income \nin 21 weeks, with money still coming in''.\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\n\n=====================================================================\nHere is another testimonial: '' this program has been around for \na long time but I never believed in it.

First month I only made a small amount of money,  \nbut the next 2 months after that I made a total of a good 6 figures.  \nSo far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made \na lot more and I am playing it again.

Let's also assume that the mailing\nreceive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much\nbetter but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also, many people\nmay send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only\n5,000 each).\n\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each\nfor a total of 50,000.  Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\nresponded with orders.  That's = 100 people responded and\nordered Report #2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails\neach for a total of 500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to\nthat is 1000 orders for Report #3.\n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n5 million e-mails sent out.  The 0.2% response to that is\n10,000 orders for Report #4.  Those 10,000 people send out\n5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million)\nEmails.  The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\nReport #5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (a half\nmillion).\n\n  Your total income in this example is:\n  1..... $50 +\n  2..... $500 +\n  3..... $5,000 +\n  4..... $50,000 +\n  5..... $500,000 ......... Grand Total = $555,550.00\n\n  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.  GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT\n  THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU\n  CALCULATE IT, YOU CAN STILL MAKE MONEY!\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n  REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\n  ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.\n\nDare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone,\nor 1/2, or even one 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails\neach or more?  There are over 500 million people on the\nInternet worldwide and counting.  Believe me, many people\nmay do just that, and more!\n\n  METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n  ===================================================\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there\nare hundreds of FREE places to advertise.  Placing a lot of\nfree ads on the Internet can easily get a larger response.\nWe strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD\n# 2 as you go along.\n\nFor every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the\nReport they ordered.  That's it!  Always provide same day\nservice on all orders. This will guarantee that the emails\nthey send out, with your name and address on it, will be\nprompt because they can not advertise until they receive the\nreport.\n\n  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\n\nNote:  Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report.\nChecks or money orders are NOT accepted.  Make sure the cash\nis wrapped in at least 2 sheets of paper before you put it in\nthe envelope. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER\nand the NAME of the Report you are ordering, your email ADDRESS,\nyour NAME and postal address. Make sure you affix proper\n'International' Postage if ordering a report from outside your\ncountry.\n\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:\n=============================================================\n\n\nReport 1: The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On \nThe Net ...

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!\n\n==================== MORE TESTIMONIALS======================\n\n'' My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago.  \nI am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make \npretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled \nto Jody about receiving ''junk mail''.  I made fun of the \nwhole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and \npercentages involved.  I ''knew'' it wouldn't work.  Jody \ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later \nshe jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, \nand was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when \nthe thing didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within \n3 weeks she had received 50 responses within the next 45 days \nshe had so many orders and ... all cash! I was shocked.  I\nhave joined Jody in her ''hobby''. \nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\n===============================================================\n\n'' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make \nup my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that \nI am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that \nthere was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at \nleast get my money back''.  '' I was surprised when I found my \nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.  I made a large \n6 figure income in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this \ndeal is that it does not matter where people live.  There simply \nisn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''.\nDan\nSondstrom, Alberta,\nCanada\n================================================================\n\n'' I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later \nI wondered if I should have given it a try.  Of course, I had no \nidea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until \nI was e-mailed again by someone else ........ 11 months passed \nthen it luckily came again ...... I did not delete this one! I \nmade a six figure income on my first try and all the money came\nwithin 22 weeks''. \nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\n================================================================\n\n'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money \nwith little cost to you.  I followed the simple instructions \ncarefully and within 10 days the money started to come in.  My \nfirst month I made a substantial income and by the end of the\nthird month my total cash count was a healthy 6 figure income.\nLife is beautiful, Thanks to internet''. \nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\n\n================================================================\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON\nYOUR ROAD TO GENERATING EXTRA INCOME! \n================================================================\n\nDisclaimer:\nThe sender or participants of this marketing program cannot\nverify any monetary claims made in this document, nor do they\nassume responsibility for same.
