Others build a sizable<BR>\norganization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>\noffices.<BR>\n<BR>\nToday our company and our associates have over 126<BR>\nmillion dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>\nprocessing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>\nof joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>\nJoint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>\neven when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on<BR>\nthe reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>\ncapability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>\nofficers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>\nfor reports.<BR>\n<BR>\n<BR>\nMany of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>\nforce of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>\nLegally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>\nrefinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%<BR>\ninterest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>\nAnnual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to<BR>\n$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>\npayment of the principal.<BR>\n<BR>\nOur associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>\nyear. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>\nand not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>\nadd substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>\nsold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>\nan associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>\ntheir business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR>\n<BR>\n92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%<BR>\nare women and 36% are part time .<BR>\n<BR>\nOne of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>\nnot under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>\nfor a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>\nworking on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>\nare still in force, they do not disappear.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>\ncomputer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>\nnever confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you<BR>\nare. You are not a collection agency.<BR>\n<BR>\nSimply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>\nare as follows:<BR>\n<BR>\nMail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>\nwith Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>\nto write to)<BR>\n<BR>\n8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>\nand ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them<BR>\nunless you want to.<BR>\n<BR>\nYou send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>\nsign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<BR>\n50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>\n$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR>\n<BR>\nYou then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>\nand their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>\nassist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>\ncredit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>\nlocates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>\nThe prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>\n1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>\n$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>\ncompanies charge $25.00.<BR>\n<BR>\nOnce you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>\ngarnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>\n(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>\ncourse)<BR>\n<BR>\nWhen you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<BR>\nthe original Judgment holder.<BR>\n<BR>\nOnce the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>\nJudgment to the court.
