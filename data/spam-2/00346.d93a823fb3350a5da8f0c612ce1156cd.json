I \nhave decided to inherit this money which was taken out \nand deposited with the said security/finance company \nas cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is \nkept in my signature and would have been used in the \npurchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of \ncontinuing the civil war in Angola.The supreme \ncommander is dead and as already stated I have decided \nto quite the whole thing and this is without regard to \nthe fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! \nI want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit \nthe $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have \nbeen able to establish contact with the company in \nSouth Africa to the effect that I would soon come to \ntake possession of the money that I kept with them. \nNote also that I deposited the money as a foreign \nnational who is the head of a Mining company in Angola \n(Never as a commander of UNITA). If you are able to \ncooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% \nof the $32million.Please come back to me through \nemail: edum@hkem.com.The security/finance \ncompany is standing by to receive my instructions on \nthis and I will link you up with them as soon as you \nare ready to take possession of the $32million. \nFinally you are to note that in you reply, you are to \nstate your residential or company address and if \npossible send a copy of your international passport so \nas to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. \nYours truly, \nEduado de Mello \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\ndcms-dev mailing list\ndcms-dev@eros.cs.jhu.edu\nhttp://www.eros-os.org/mailman/listinfo/dcms-dev\n"}
