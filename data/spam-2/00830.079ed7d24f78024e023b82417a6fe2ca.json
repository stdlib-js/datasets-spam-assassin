Let's also assume th=\nat the mailing=20\nreceive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much bet=\nter but lets=20\njust say it is only 0.2%). Also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thou=\nsands e-mails=20\ninstead of only 5,000 each).\n=A0\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2=\n% response,=20\nthat is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sendi=\nng out 5,000 e-\nmail each for a total of 50,000.
