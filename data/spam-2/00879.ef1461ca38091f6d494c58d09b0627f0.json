Veuve Clicquot Speaks=20\n    Interview with Naomi Hancock, PR Manager, Veuve Clicquot UK - July 10=\n,=20\n2002\n---------------------------------------------------------------------=20\n=20\n  On the occasion of the Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo in West Sussex,=20\nNaomi Hancock reveals Veuve Clicquot's communication strategy.=20\n=20\nVeuve Clicquot has had a single consistent communication strategy in the=20\nUK for the last 15 years. This has been to associate the brand with the=20\nmost glamorous sporting cultural and social events of the English summer =\n-=20\nknown locally as The English Season.=20\n\nVeuve Clicquot has become the Champagne of the Season. We've adapted our=20\ncommunication to stay at the forefront of fashion, and attitudes to these=\n=20\nevents, which combine tradition with the excitement of world class sport.=\n=20\n\n\n  Does your company consider sponsorship a key marketing/communication=20\ntool?\n\nAbsolutely. Sponsorship enables us to build positive associations for the=\n=20\nbrand. But we are not interested in tacking our name onto an event where=20\nthe addition does not add real value to the event and vica-versa. We=20\nbelieve in investing, nurturing, and improving over time.=20\n\n\n  Can you describe your sponsorship strategy?\n\nWe aim to maximise the perception of Veuve Clicquot as the Champagne of=20\nthe Season. Everything we do is designed to build a partnership, and=20\nenhance the valuable efforts of our partners, in their own creation, and=20\ndevelopment of their events. Our buzz word is integration, as we seek to=20\nmake The Season central to our marketing mix.=20\n\n\n  Can you describe your sponsorship decision-making process?\n\nWe usually discuss a sponsorship programme for the full year with our=20\nmother company in France. We have flexibility - within our budget and the=\n=20\nframe of The Season - to undertake what we sense to match our values and=20\nthe image of Veuve Clicquot. Our role in London is to screen whatever=20\ncomes to us and discuss relevant operations internally.\n\nWe have a dedicated PR Group at Veuve Clicquot which makes all decisions=20\nrelated to our sponsorship. Above a certain threshold our head-office wil=\nl=20\nlike to be involved in such a decision.=20\n\n\n  What are the main criteria on which you base your sponsorship strategy?\n\nReturn on investment is the key criterion for any marketing investment=20\ndecision. We would only undertake sponsorship in Season-related events.=20\nThis is our rule and frame of investment.\n\n\n  What objectives are you seeking to achieve through sponsorship?\n\nWithin the Season, we are especially looking to achieve visibility vis-=E0=\n-\nvis our audience, image-transfer, media coverage (all national press,=20\nmagazine of all kinds).=20\n\nAwareness is also key for Veuve Clicquot, so we look to find events that=20\ncomplement those that we already have, and extend our appeal to people of=\n=20\nsimilar status, but differing interests.=20\n\n\n  Please describe one of your sponsorships\n\nThe Eighth Annual Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo, held this month at Cowdra=\ny=20\nPark in West Sussex, is the largest entertainment operation undertaken by=\n=20\nVeuve Clicquot UK each year. This successful sponsorship earns Veuve=20\nClicquot tremendous media coverage, fabulous exposure to our core target=20\ngroup and a perfect image transfer as polo is the sports of kings and the=\n=20\nking of sports.\n\n\n  What's your approximate sponsorship spend per year?\n\nSignificant. Without giving figures, we can say that we spend a large=20\nportion of our communication in sponsorship and support and that we=20\norganize the majority of our communication around the theme of Veuve=20\nClicquot as the Champagne of the Season, because this is where we are=20\ngetting a good return on our investment.\n\n\n  How do you measure the effectiveness of your sponsorship?\n\n------=_ZnkAvjw6_o9xevs6y_MA--\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightings\n\n\n"}
