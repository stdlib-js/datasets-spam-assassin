I have decided to contact you\nwith greatest delight and personal respect.\n\nWell, I am BELLO SANKOH, Son to MR FODAY SANKOH\nwho was arrested by the ECOMAOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE\nmonths ago in my country Sierra Leone.\nFew days before the arrest of my father, he confided\nin me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and\nmove out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and\nCash Receipt he made with a security Company in\nAbidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box\ncontaining USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two\nMillion dollars cash). This money was made from the\nsell of\nGold and Diamond by my FATHER and he have already\ndecided to use this money for future investment of\nthe family before his arrest.\n\nThereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these\ndocuments and confirmed the deposit of the box by my\nfather. Also, I have been granted political stay as a\nRefugee by the Government of C=F4te d'Ivoire.\n\nMeanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a\ntrusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this\nmoney from C=F4te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .\nBased on this , I solicit for your assistance to\ntransfer this fund into your Account, but I will\ndemand for the following requirement:\n\n(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where\nthis fund will be transferred to in your country or\nanother nearby country where taxation will not\ntake great toll on the money?\n\n(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my\ntravelling papers after this transfer to enable me\ncome over to meet you in your country for\nthe investment of this money?\n\n(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable\nbusiness venture that would not require much technical\nexpertise in your country where part of this fund\nwill be invested?\n\nPlease, all these requirements are urgently needed as\nit will enable me to establish a stronger business\nrelationship with you hence I will like you to be the\ngeneral overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a\nChristian and I will please, want you to handle this\ntransaction based on the trust I have established\non you.\n\nFor your assistance in this transaction, I have\ndecided to offer you 12% percent commission of the\ntotal amount ( 22 million dollars ) at the end of this\nbusiness. The security of this business is very\nimportant to me and as such,\nI would like you to keep this business very\nconfidential.\n\nI shall expect your urgent reply.\n\nMy telephone number is 22507625348.\n\nThank you and God bless you\nBELLO SANKOH Tel :22507625348\n\n_________________________________________________________ \nEnvoyez des messages musicaux sur le portable de vos amis \n http://mobile.lycos.fr/mobile/local/sms_musicaux/\n\n\n--=_NextPart_Caramail_0326951023460633_ID--\n\n"}
