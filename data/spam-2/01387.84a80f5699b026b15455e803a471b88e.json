I am requesting that you create a link from jmason.org to my client's web site if you feel that their content is in some way related or complements your site. In exchange, I'll post a link from their site to yours.  \n\nExchanging links will help bring in more business for both your web site and my client's. An added benefit is increased search engine traffic because the search engines rank sites higher that have a good number of relevant links.\n\nThis is not a free-for-all link exchange, I don't waste my time with them and you shouldn't either. I am only linking to related web sites so that all my links are relevant to my site.\n\nI would like to send you my client's web address, so that you can review their site. My client offers web site promotion and and optimization services for search engines. \n\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in exchanging links. I'll send you more details once I hear back from you.\n\nLooking forward to your reply.\n\nSincerely,\nDonna Martos\ndonnamartos@link-builder.com\nhttp://www.link-builder.com\n\nP.S. If for any reason you don't want me to contact again, just email me and let me know.\n\n\n"}
