We know that current Home-\nMailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their\ntestimonials. This makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue\nour success together. Here are just a couple of the many testimonials\nreceived from Home-Mailers:\n  \n  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity\n  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along\n  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is\n  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes\n  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us\n  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!\n     J. Thomas ------ Miami, FL\n  \n  Thank you for everything! I was having trouble\n  making ends meet at my present employment. But\n  thanks to you and your Home-Mailers Program, I was\n  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the\n  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well\n  deserved vacation.\n     M. Daniels ----- Seattle, WA\n  \nWhy do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is more\nexpensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per square\nfoot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +\ntaxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,\nmultiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants\nand more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!\nYour role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not an\nemployee. We will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer\nmedical or dental insurance. As a Home-Mailer, your residence and many\nother aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business\nexpenses. Receive cash-back on your taxes! You may request copies of\npersonal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. All business can \nbe done by mail, from your own home. You can start the same day you\nreceive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a\nsteady income as long as you desire. These positions require no prior\nexperience or special skills. There are many distribution companies who\nwant to expand their businesses, but do not want to pay the higher \nexpenses. It is much easier to have independent Home-Mailers earn \nmoney doing this work themselves. This program is designed to help \npeople cash in with a company who needs Home-Mailers. The Home-Mailers\nProgram has been perfected so that it has become one of the most \nsuccessful and profitable programs ever and is supplying people around the\nworld with excellent primary and secondary incomes. We invite you to take\npart in our success. The money you earn is up to you. We do not require \nthat you mail a certain number of envelopes each week. You can take on\nwhatever amount of business that fits your schedule and you can stop\nwhenever you want, there are no obligations. There is no need to do any\ndoor to door selling or phone soliciting. You may work in the comfort of your\nown home, choose your own hours, set your own pace. No need to leave\nyour present job. Form workshops with your friends or get the whole family \nto join in. The possibilities are UNLIMITED!\n  \n  DUE TO COMPANY EXPANSION\n  YOUR SERVICES ARE NEEDED NOW.\n  Thank you, and we're looking forward to working\n  with you, together in the future.\n  \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  <B>\n</B>\n</FONT></HTML>\n\n\n\n"}
