Unlike the original .COM and .NET domain names, the new .NAME domain was specifically created for individuals such as yourself. The .NAME domain appears in the format: FirstName.LastName.NAME For example, if your name is Monica Smith, then you can register a name such as monica.smith.name Technology experts predict that personalized domain names will soon be used as international identifiers much the same was that phone numbers are used today. For a limited time, you can pre-register your unique .NAME domain for only $10 (plus applicable registry fees) at: http://www.namesforeveryone.com \n\n\nTo remove your email address from further promotional mailings from this company, click here:\nhttp://www.centralremovalservice.com/cgi-bin/domain-remove.cgi\n21\n9488ycte7-565FWHF6137iGcL4-997l28\n\n"}
