You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend\nto work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day\nactivities and it's soon forgotten.\n\nThe program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very\nseriously.\n\nAnyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my\nsponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 2000\nPAID members in my downline!\n\nAs you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I\nhave more than 2000 paid members under me in a program that I had\nnever promoted?\n\nI took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking\nfor confirmation that these were paid members and not just free\nsign-ups...like me :)\n\nWell, it was true...I had 2365 paid members in my downline. This\nin a program that I had never worked!\n\nAll I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end\nof the month and I would have my position locked in and a\ndownline of 2365 people.\n\nYou can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!\n\nI can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this\nprogram, I would have become an active paid member months ago!\n\nWith this program, you will get a HUGE downline of PAID MEMBERS.\nMy sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every\nmonth...on time.\n\nHow would you like to lock your position in FREE while you check\nout this opportunity and watch your downline grow?\n\nTo grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to:gitrman@excite.com\nand write this phrase:\n\"Email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities\"\nBe sure to include your:\n1. First name\n2. Last name\n3. Email address (if different from above)\n\nWe will confirm your position and send you a special report\nas soon as possible, and also Your Free Member Number.\n\nI'll get you entered and let you know how you can\nkeep track of your growing downline.\n\nThat's all there's to it.\n\nI'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nBruce Stevens\n\nP.S. After having several negative experiences with network\nmarketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.\nThis company is different--it offers value, integrity, and a\nREAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...\nand finally make real money on the internet.\n\nDon't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the\nprogram for FREE. All you need to do is get your free\nmembership.\n\n\n0754quAQ5-965nKuK1727EMl22\n"}
