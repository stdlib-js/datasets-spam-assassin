First, I must\nsolicit your strictest\nconfidentiality in this transaction. This is by\nvirtue of its nature\nas being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and \"TOP SECRET\".\nThough I know that a\ntransaction of this magnitude will make any one\napprehensive and\nworried,considering the fact that we have not met\neach other before,\nbut I am assuring you that all will be well at the\nend of the day. We\nhave decided to contact you by email due to the\nurgency of this\ntransaction, as we have been reliably informed that\nit will take at\nleast a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal\npost to reach you,\nso we decided it is best using the e-mail,which is\nquicker and also\nto enable us meet up with the second quater payment\nfor the year\n2000. \n\nHowever, let me start by introducing myself properly\nto you. I\nam Dr.tom eke, a Director General in the Department\nOf Petroleum \nResources(D.P.R) and I presently head The Contract\nAward Panel incharge\nof Contract Awards and Payment Approvals. I came to\nknow of you in my search for a reliable and\nreputable person to\nhandle a very confidential business transaction\nwhich involves the\ntransfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account\nrequiring\nmaximum CONFIDENCE. I and my colleagues are Top\nOfficials of the\nFederal Government Contract Award Panel. Our duties\ninclude Evaluation, Vetting, Approval for payment of\nContract jobs\ndone for the D.P.R e.t.c. In order to commence this\nbusiness we\nsolicit for your assistance to enable us transfer\ninto your Account\nthe said funds. The source of this funds is as\nfollows: In the second\nquarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to\nreview and award\ncontracts to the tune of US$400 million US dollars\nto a group of five\nfirms for the supply construction and installation\nof Oil Pipe lines\nin Warri and Port Harcourt. During this process my\ncolleagues and I\ndecided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately\nover-inflate the\ntotal contract sum from US$400 million to US$431\nmillion United\nStates dollars with the main intention of sharing\nthe remaining sum\nof US$31 miilion amongst ourselves. \n\nThe Federal Government of Nigeria has since the\nsecond quater of\t\nyear 2001 approved the sum of US$431 million for us\nas the contract sum, \nand the sum of US$400 million has also been paid to\nthe foreign companies \nconcerned as contract entitlements for the various\ncontracts done, but \nsince the companies are entiltled to US$400 million\ndollars only, we are \nnow left with US$31 million dollars balance in the\naccount which we intend to\ndisburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our\npositions as civil\nservants and members of this panel, we cannot do\nthis by ourselves,\nas we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau\n(Civil Service\nLaws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts\nin our names\nwhile still in Government service, making it\nimpossible for us to\nacquire the money in our names right now. I have\ntherefore, been\ndelegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my\ncolleagues in the\npanel to look for an overseas partner into whose\naccount we would\ntransfer the sum of US$31 million. Hence we are\nwriting you this\nletter. My Colleagues and I have agreed that if you\nor your company\ncan act as the beneficiary of this funds on our\nbehalf, you or your\nCompany will retain 20% of the total amount (US$31\nmillion), while\n70% will be for us(OFFICIALS) and the remaining 10%\nwill be used in\noffsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurred\nboth local and\nforeign in the cause of this transfer. Needless to\nsay, the trust\nreposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In\nreturn we demand your\ncomplete honesty and trust. \n\nYou must however NOTE that this transaction will be\nstrictly based \non the following terms and conditions as we have\nstated below; \na) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and\ndiligence \nb) That you would treat this transaction with utmost\nsecrecy and confidentiality \nc) That you will not ask for more share or try to\nsit on the funds once it is under\nyour custody, or any form of blackmail. \nd) That upon receipt of the funds you will release\nthe funds as instructed \nby us after you have removed your share of 20% from\nthe total amount. \nPlease, note that this transaction is 100% legal and\nrisk free and we hope to conclude\nthis transaction seven to fourteen bank working days\nfrom the date \nof receipt of the necessary requirements from you .\nWe are looking \nforward to doing business with you and solicit your\nTotal Confidentiality\nin this transaction. There is no cause for alarm. I\ngive you my word that you\nare completely safe in doing business with us.\nTransactions like this\nhave been successfully carried out in the past by\nmost Government\nexecutives. Here in my country there is great\neconomic and political\ndisarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant\nand the order of\nthe day, thus explaining why you might have heard\nstories of how\nmoney is been taken out of Nigeria, this is because\neveryone is\nmaking desperate attempts to secure his or her\nfuture, so that when\nwe retire from active service we donot languish in\npoverty. I will\nexplain more to you when I have heard from you. \n\nPlease acknowledge the receipt of this letter using\nthe above e-mail address. \nI will bring you into the complete picture of this\npending business\ntransaction when I have heard from you and also\nreceive your\nconfidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me\nfax to you all\nnecessary information you need to know about our\npending business\ntransaction. I will also send to you my private\ntelephone and fax\nnumbers where you can always reach me. Your urgent\nresponse will be\nhighly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds\nunder the second\nquarter of the year 2002. Thank you and God Bless. \n\nYours faithfully, \n\nDr.tom eke. \n\nN.B. PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS\nTRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL\nAND COMPLETELY FREE FROM DRUG MONEY OR MONEY\nLAUNDERING. THIS IS A\nCOMPLETE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS TRANSACTION. \n-- \n\n\n"}
