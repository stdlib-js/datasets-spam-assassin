With \nour considerable experience we set out to blend the advantages of all the other of bathtubs offered in the market place into one range. After several years \ndevelopment we produced our current range and the YEMA brand bathtub was patented in 2001. We were even awarded the \"Gold Medal\" in the \"Chinese Patent Technology \nExhibition\" and \"The Ninth Chinese New Patent Technology and New Patent Product Exhibition\" later that year. The YEMA bathtubs structural design is that of a normal \nacrylic bathtub but conglutinated into a composite material. It is ridged and is made more than twice as thick as a normal unit, making it more smooth, gentle and \nelegant. This manufacturing technique not only provides all the advantages of a normal acrylic bathtub (easily to clean, resistance to dirt, colorful,attractive etc) \nbut also provides increased heat retention, and extends the products life span.\n\nBesides our products on website, we now produce some new models for USA market. We also produce shower panels with finest quality.\n\n-------------------bathtub Specifications---------------------\n1,Wall thickness:10mm~20mm\n2,Weight: 50~60KG\n\n-------------------Cooperate--------------------------------\n\nWe would like to be your OEM/ODM manufacturer.\n\nFor detailed info, please browse our website http://www.wjjzzs.com\n\nBest wishes and regards,\n\nExport Manager\nJerry Lee\nMobile:13951228561\nPhone:0086-519-5211973\nFax:  0086-519-5209776\nWujin Huangli Composited Sanitary Factory\nAdd:HUangli town,Wujin county\n    Changzhou 213151\n    Jiangsu province\n    P.R.China\nWebsie:http://www.wjjzzs.com\nEmail:wjjzzs@wjjzzs.com\n\nJuly 18, 2002\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
