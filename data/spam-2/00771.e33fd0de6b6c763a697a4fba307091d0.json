Unfortunately, no.  APAs are not accorded \nequal opportunity in workplaces presently.  \n\n\tEqual opportunity means: \"For every man, woman and \nchild to go as far and rise as high as their ambition and ability \nwill take them.\"  Statistics, mostly gathered by government \nstudies, show that AAs have only 1/3 the opportunity of all \nother Americans to rise to the top in the academic world, \ncorporate world, the federal government.  There seems to exist \nan invisible resistance to AAs' developing to the maximal of \ntheir potentials  --  A Glass Ceiling.\n\n\tLet's look at a concrete case.  A lot of our best people are \nemployed in universities.  Their average performance has been \noutstanding.  What's their chance of rising to the top?  \n\n\tUniversity administrators are recruited almost exclusively \nfrom the ranks of faculty and professionals already employed in \nuniversities.  Hence the ratio of [administrators / (faculty + \nprofessionals)], broken down to races, is a measure of the \nopportunity enjoyed by American citizens of different races.  \nNationwide, that ratio for blacks (non-Hispanic) is 0.21.  That is, \nfor every 100 black faculty and professionals there are 21 black \nadministrators.  The ratio for Native American is 0.20; for white \n(non-Hispanic) is 0.16; and for Hispanic is 0.15.  However, it is \nonly 0.06 for Asian American.  Get on the Web and check it out \nfor yourself!  Source:  Dept. of Education - <www.ed.gov/NCES/ \npubs/96323.html>, Table B-1f.\n\n\tThe above dismal picture emerges from the supposedly \n\"enlightened\" academic world.  The situation in the corporate \nworld, state and federal governments is worse.  \n\n\tIn E-Mail 2 & 3, we present a strategy to induce the two \nmajor political parties to help us fight for equal opportunity and \nhelp make our beloved nation \"a more perfect Union.\"   There has \nalready been progress on account of that strategy.  Behold how the \nglass ceiling in the federal government is being shattered, owing\nsignificantly to the bloc-vote organized and delivered by 80-20 in \nthe 2000 election.\n\n\nSincerely (members of Steering Comm., titles for ID purposes only)\n\nRajen Anand, Secretary, Federation of Indian-Am.
