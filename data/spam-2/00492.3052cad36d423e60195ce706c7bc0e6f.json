You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend\nto work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day\nactivities and it's soon forgotten.\n\nThe program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very seriously.\n\nAnyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my \nsponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 1000 \nPAID members in my group!\n\n As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I \nhave more than 1000 paid members under me in a program that I had\nnever promoted?\n\nI took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking \nfor confirmation that these were paid members and not just free \nsign-ups...like me :)\n\nWell, it was true...I had over 1000 paid members in my group. This \nis a program that I had never worked!\n\n All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end \nof the month and I would have my position locked in and a group of over 1000\n people.\n\n You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!\n\nI can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this program,\n I would have become an active paid member months ago!\n\n With this program, you will get a HUGE group of PAID MEMBERS.\nMy sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every\nmonth...on time.\n\nHow would you like to lock your position in FREE while you check\nout this opportunity and watch your group grow?\n\nTo grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to:  sejr102@yahoo.com\nand write this phrase:\n\n\"Email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities\"\nBe sure to include your:\n1. First name\n2. Last name\n3. Email address (if different from above)\n\nOnce I receive your reply, I will submit your information and you \nwill receive an e-mail titled \"your name, Activate Your FREE Membership Today!\" You will then need to confirm your FREE Membership.\nWe will then send you a special report, along with your Free Membership ID Number and also let you know how you can keep track of your growing group, then you can make up your own mind.\n\nThat's all there is to it.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nSean\n\n P.S. After having several negative experiences with network\nmarketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.\nThis company is different--it offers value, integrity, and a\nREAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...\nand finally make real money on the internet.\n\nDon't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the\nprogram for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free\nmembership.\n\n \n============================================================================\n\n=========\n\"This email is sent in compliance with strict anti-abuse and NO SPAM\nregulations.
