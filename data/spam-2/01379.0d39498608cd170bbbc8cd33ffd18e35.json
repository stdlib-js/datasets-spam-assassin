It maintains a cache, and will avoid stories you've already    read. It can handle 1-page sites, 1-page with diffing, 2- and 3-level sites as well    as My-Netscape-style RSS sites. It's also very easy to add a new site to its list.    Even if you don't have a PalmPilot, it's still handy for simple website-to-text    conversion. Site files are included for many popular news sites including Slashdot,    LWN, Freshmeat and Linux Today.\nhttp://jmason.org/software/sitescooper/\nYour category: http://topsitez.us/category-tab.htm?id=713164&d=spamassassin.taint.org\n\nREACH A MILLION\nHere is what you get:\n1. We will continue to list your site in the TopSites directories.\n2. We will show your listing more than a million times a year (guaranteed).\n\nLet us introduce you (a million times!)\nPeople often ask, \"How can you guarantee to show my listing a million times? What if I am in an unpopular category?\" It does not matter! Why? AutoSearch--our patent pending tool--continually displays renewed TopSites-us listings on our users� PCs 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We display TopSites-us listings more than 42 million times in an hour. That is why we can guarantee to show your listing more than a million times a year. \n\nSave $40,000 in adverting \nIt would cost you up to $40,000 to display your listing a million times at sites like MSN and Altavista. Googles charges up to $200,000 depending on your category. At TopSites we charge $5 a month!\n\nSave $100 re-listing fee\nPlease do not let your listing expire. Our editors listed you as one of the top websites in your category without charge. If your listing expires, however, you may need to pay a $100 editorial review fee to get listed again. It can take a month for our editors to authorize a listing. And they may not re-list you if there are too many listings in your category. \n\nOnly TopSites-us gives you: \n* Massive Reach: We display our listings billions of times a year. We guarantee to show your listing more than a million times a year.\n* Cost-Effectiveness: This is the least expensive advertising you will ever buy. You want to bring lots of potential customers to your site in a cost-effective way. TopSites-us does exactly that! \n* Highly Targeted Leads: TopSites-us reaches customers when they are searching for what you are selling. That means high sales and low costs. More visitors become customers! \n* Highest Return on Investment: Independent research confirms that you get the highest ROI from online listings like TopSites-us. E-mail, banners and other forms of online advertising all have a lower ROI. And unlike direct mail, you pay nothing for mailing lists, printing or postage. No media buy returns better results than TopSites-us. \n* No-Risk: Cancel your listing any time for any reason--no questions asked!\n* Hassle-Free: Change your listing anytime or even move it to a different category--for free--and your changes will instantly appear in the directory\n�\n\"TopSites-us is the least expensive way I have found to bring buyers to my site. I have tried other online advertising companies and you beat everyone!\" \n--P.A., President, Go Software (g-o.us) \n\n\"TopSites-us makes my online marketing easy. I can change my message 24 hours a day so it is always up-to-date. And everyone who sees it is a pre-qualified prospect.\" \n--N.B., CEO, My News (my-news.org)\n�\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n�\nCan I change my listing?\nYou can change your listing now or later. You can rewrite the headline and description before renewing. You can change the URL too�even to another website. \nOnce we receive payment, we will send you instructions on how to change your listing whenever you like. (There�s no charge to do this.)\n\nCan I change my category? \nCan I list my site in additional categories?\nCan I list other sites too?\nYou can list as many sites in as many categories as you like. Each listing costs only $5 per month per category. Just go to www.topsitez.us. Click on the category links until you find the one you want (or search on your keywords). Click on the Add My Site link. Then type your listing. If your old listing was in the wrong category, you can click unsubscribe to cancel it.\n\nHow much does a listing cost?\nCan I renew for free?\nIt costs $5 a month to list your site in TopSites. We no longer offer any free listings. We will bill you $60 for 12 months. There are no additional costs. You can change your listing as often as you like for free. You can cancel your listing anytime and we will refund your remaining money.\n\nHow do I pay? \nYou can pay with a U.S. check, money order or bank draft. Or you can pay by Visa, MasterCard or American Express. Simply select the option you prefer on the renewal form. (Unfortunately, we cannot cash overseas checks at this time.)\n\nWho listed us?\nWhen did our listing start?\nWe do not know. Sorry. We only began to track listing contacts and dates this year.\n\nHow much did we pay to be listed? \nOriginally you couldn�t buy a listing--you had to wait for our editors to select you as one of the top sites in your category.\n\nDo we have a contract with you?\nWe don�t ask our customers to sign contracts for a $5 a month service.\n\nCan you call me and tell me more?\nWe are happy to answer all your questions by email but we don�t contact our customer by phone at this time. Sorry.\n\nCan I still renew after your deadline?\nWe give our customers a month to renew so don�t worry too much about the deadline.\n\nHow do I see my listing? I couldn�t find it when I searched.\nYou can go to www.topsitez.us and click on the categories until you get to /Top/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Linux/Projects/Internet.\nYou can also see it at www.topsitez.us by entering two or more keywords from your listing into our search form. Since we have more than three million listings, you probably won�t find your listing by searching on only one word. And you definitely won�t find it if you search on words that are not in your listing. \n\nWhat keywords display my listing? \nHow do I change them?\nEvery word in your listing is a keyword. Anytime someone searches on two or more words in your listing, we will display it. The only way to change your keywords is to change the headline or description of your listing.\n\nHow much traffic did you send us last year?\nWe don�t know. Sorry. We are working on adding this feature.\n\n..for more answers go to:\nhttp://topsitez.us/faq/index.htm?id=713164&d=jmason.org&op=cat&c=1\n\n------=_NextPart_000_000B_01C238C5.A7241DF0\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=\"us-ascii\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n\n\n<html><head><title>Renew</title></head><body>\n<b><font face=\"ARIAL\" color=\"#000066\">TOPSITES LLC</font></b><br>\n<font color=\"#000066\">1300 Evans Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94120-7334 USA - Phone 415-294-5300</font>\n  \n  <p>Could you please be so kind as to click on the Renew button to renew <a href=\"http://topsitez.us/category-tab.htm?id=713164&d=jmason.org\">your \n    listing</a> in the <a href=\"http://topsitez.us/home-tab.htm?id=713164&d=jmason.org\">TopSites-us</a> \n    directory listing by Thursday, December 5, if you do not mind?
