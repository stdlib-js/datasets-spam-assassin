I am sorry this mail\nWill surprise you, though we do not know, \nDue to the current war against white farmers in\nZimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to\nClaim all white owned farms in our country to gain\nFavor for re-election.\n\nAll white farmers were asked to\nSurrender their farms to the government for\nRe-distribution and infact to his political party\nMembers and my father though black was the treasury\nof the farmers association and a strong member of an\nOpposition party that did not support the president\nIdea. He then ordered his party members and the police\nUnder his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn\nDown everything in the farm. They killed my\nFather and took away a lot of items from his farm.\nAfter the death of my father, our local pastor and a\nClose friend of my father handed us over will\nDocuments with instructions from my father that we\nShould leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will \nDocuments has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit\nKept in custody for us in a security company unknown\nTo the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as \nPersonal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could\nEasily be found by his enemies. The total amount is\nUS$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for\nYour assistance to help us move the fund out of\nZimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from\nreality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of\nInternational Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the \nFinance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer\nClearance above US$1M is just a few of the\nUnthinkable things he is committing in my Country.\nI have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.\nJohn Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was\nLeaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family\nLate last year following this ugly development to no\nAvail.\nShould you be interested to help us, contact me\nImmediately via email for easy communication and I\nWill furnish you with the time frame and modalities of\nthe transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of \nCaring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that \nThis transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will \nNot endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%\nOf the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any\nAccount of your choice were the incident of taxation\nwill not take much tool on the money and we look\nForward to coming over to your country to invest our\nShare and settle there. I will a private\nPhone so that our conversation can be\n100% confidential.\n\nNOTE: DO REPLY TO bulmulete@golfemail.com\n\n\nGod bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.\n\nMr. BULAWA  MULETE JR\n \n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
