You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't \ndelete this!!! \n------------------------------------------------------ \nFirst read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... \nAS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. \nPARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN \nIN HIS CLOSET! \nDoes this headline look familiar? Of course it does. \nYou most likely have just seen this story recently \nfeatured on a major nightly news program (USA). \nAnd reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck \nof the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning \nand putting laundry away when she came across a large \nbrown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath \nsome clothes and a skateboard in the back of her \n15-year-old sons closet. \nNothing could have prepared her for the shock she got \nwhen she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. \nFive-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - \nall neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. \n\"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank\", \nsays the 41-year-old woman, \"There was over $71,000 \ndollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband \nearns in a year\". \nThe woman immediately called her husband at the \ncar-dealership where he worked to tell him what she \nhad discovered. He came home right away and they \ndrove together to the boys school and picked him up. \nLittle did they suspect that where the money came from \nwas more shocking than actually finding it in \nthe closet. \nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via \nE-mail, a type of \"Report\" to E-mail addresses that he \nobtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for \nthe past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his \ncomputer in his bedroom. \n\"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the \nheck, I put my name on it like the instructions said \nand I started sending it out\", says the clever \n15-year-old. \nThe E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained \ninstructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person \non the list, then delete the address at the top and \nmove the others addresses down, and finally to add \nyour name to the top of the list. \nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive \nseveral thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 \nweeks if you sent out the letter with your \nname at the top of the 5-address list. \"I get junk \nE-mail all the time, and really did not think it was \ngoing to work\", the boy continues. \nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, \nthe Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him \nfor his video-game magazine subscriptions began to \nfill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing \n$5 bills. \n\"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post \noffice and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 \nenvelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip \nthat said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. \nI thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)\". He \ngoes on, \"I went up to the counter and they had a \nwhole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back \nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not \ncarry it all\". \nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending \nout the E-mail. \"The money just kept coming in and I \njust kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, \nbarely had time for my homework\". He had also \nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his \narea and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties \nand hundreds. \n\"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept \nriding to different banks with like five thousand at a \ntime in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at \nthe bank counter that my dad had sent me in to \nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. \nOne time the lady gave me a really strange look and \ntold me that she would not be able to do it for me and \nmy dad would have to come in and do it, but I just \nrode to the next bank down the street (laughs).\" \nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be \nafraid. The reporting news team examined and \ninvestigated the so-called \"chain-letter\" the boy was \nsending out and found that it was not a chain-letter \nat all. In fact, it was completely legal according to \nUS Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and \n1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also \nin the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, \nSections 255 and 436, which state a product or service \nmust be exchanged for money received. \nEvery five-dollar bill that he received contained a \nlittle note that read, \"Please send me report number \nXYX\".This simple note made the letter legal because he \nwas exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a \nfive-dollar fee. \n[This is the end of the media release. If you would \nlike to understand how the system works and get your \n$71,000 - please continue reading.

This is the \nletter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the \npopularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news \nprogram \nrecently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program \ndescribed below, to see if it really can make people money. The show \nalso \ninvestigated whether or not the program was legal. \nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO \nLaws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow \nthe simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only \n$25 out of pocket cost''. \nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS \nPROGRAM HAS \nATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. \nThis is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. \nI was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so \nglad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for \nthe minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received \ntotal \n$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. \nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. \n=========================================================\n=======Here is \nanother testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a \nlong time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this \nagain in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the \nsimple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to \ncome \nin. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that \nmade a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering \nthe \nprogram, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The \nkey to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change \nanything.''

To assist \nyou with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you \npurchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which \nincludes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of \nfree \nclassified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this \nventure going: \nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY \n=========================================================\n======= \nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and \nwe will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. \nLet's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the \nresponse \ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many \npeople will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 \neach).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. \nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 \nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total \nof 50,000. \nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 \npeople responded and ordered Report # 2. \nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 \ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. \nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 \nmillion e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders \nfor Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a \ntotal of \n50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 \norders for \nReport # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half \nmillion). \nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 \n+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand \nTotal=$555,550.00 \nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE.

Dare to think for a moment what would happen if \neveryone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails \neach or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide \nand counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! \nMETHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET \n=========================================================\n======= \nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are \nhundreds of FREE places to advertise.

I am an \naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good \nmoney. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \n''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of \nthe population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody \ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in \nwith \nboth feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old \n''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was \non me! \nWithin 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she \nhad \nreceived total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have \njoined \nJody in her ''hobby''. \nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois \n=========================================================\n======= '' Not \nbeing the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my \nmind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided \nthat the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that \nI \nwouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was \nsurprised \nwhen I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made \n$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is \nthat it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better \ninvestment \nwith a faster return and so big''. \nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada \n=========================================================\n======= '' I had \nreceived this program before. I deleted it, but later I \nwondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who \nto contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed \nagain by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came \nagain.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my \nfirst try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. \nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y. \n=========================================================\n====== \n'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with \nlittle cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and \nwithin 10 days the money started to come in.
