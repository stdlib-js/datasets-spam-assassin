This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!\n\nWe have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater \"Sensitivity / Responsiveness\" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature \"smokables\" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This \"Shangrila\" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!\n must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves \"potent significance\" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after \"flowering\" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all \"viripotent,\" which makes this \"gnarly stoke\" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve \"viripotency\" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!\ng time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.\n\nSuffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, \"sensitive/responsive\", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (\"Smoka\") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!\n\n* Mill-stoned & honed.\n* Depressive regressive!\n* Psychologically uplifting!\n* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!\n* Sophisticated, well-balanced \"ambiance.\"\n* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.\n* \"Potentiated\" & viripotent!\n* 4 ï¿½ 5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.\n* Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)\n* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!\n* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.\n* Easy on, easy off!\n* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!\n* No \"munchie\" factor.\n* No failed drug tests!\n\nShangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly \"SweetGrass\" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent \"Smoka\", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of \"Smoka\" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent \"Sensitive / Responsive\" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!\n\nShangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) \"Sensitive/Responsive\" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.\n\nShangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.

Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!\nally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.\n\nProsaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. \n\nSuggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) \n\nAlso Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.\n\n********************************************************\nPROSAKA PRICING:\n\n* One 100 count bag ... $55.00 plus shipping\n* One 300 count container ... $130.00 plus shipping\nFor larger quantities, please inquire.\n\n(See Intro Offers at bottom of this text for further savings!)\n\n*******************************************\n**AQUEOUS KATHMANDU (tm) (Happy Drops)**\n*******************************************\n\n\"Personal Choice\" enhanced \"Sensitivity\" for non-smokers & tokers.\n\nAqueous Kathmandu has only been offered to market at large for a short while.
