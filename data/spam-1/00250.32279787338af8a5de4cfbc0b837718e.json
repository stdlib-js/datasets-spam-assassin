(v1.52f) Business\nImportance: Normal\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n\nIt was the Spring of 1979.  \n\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\n\nStealing other kids' lunch money.\n\nNo, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\nthem a little deal.  \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said,\n\"and I'll bring you five dollars next week.\"  The investment\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \nwhen \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \nlonger.\n\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \nthings on their mind than last year's lunch money.\n\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\nand I didn't even get beat up.\n\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \nsecrets you will ever learn.\n\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\nyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before \ngrabbing the lifejacket.\n\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\n\nThe \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\nyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\n\"NEVER\".  \n\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\nfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars\nin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:\n\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\n\nHell no!\n\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to\nmake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old \nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \n\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\n\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\nit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the \nmoney.\n\nWhat I'm talking about here is day trading.  \n\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \nhe makes money. \n\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \n\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \namounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you \nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\n\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \n\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \nstrategies to make money.  \n\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\nring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell\ndon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\nto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty \ndollars.\n\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\n\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \nperson.\n\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \nper trade.\n\nHere is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\n\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\na few hours of studying.  \n\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\nthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:\n\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\n\n** Anyone can do it.\n\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\n\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become\nwealthy overnight.

The \nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\n\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.
