What is \"Ghetto\" \nAmerica, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, \nthis explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is \nno less true! \"Ghetto\" America is a society of individuals \ncomprised primarily of African Americans who represent the \nimpoverished, and often unpolished side of \"Black America;\" \nConfused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a \ntypical ghetto community; namely the \"projects\" and noticed an \nunusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular \nneighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have \nbeen to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young \n\"teen looking\" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby \ncarriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also \nnoticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying \nthem. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the \nabsence of the all important \"wedding band\" missing from their \nrespective ring fingers!\" .And of course we have all heard \nstories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly \nmugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know \nthat many young African American women refuse to date African \nAmerican males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In \nfact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who \nrepresent the subversive side of society; commonly known as \n\"Thugs\" or \"Street Hustlers;\" Also, did you know that many young \nAfrican American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while \nliving in government housing better known as the \"projects\" \nrather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make \ninvestments?\n \n    \"Attention\" This is Not another \"Boyz in the Hood\" Story!\n \nThese newly distinguished \"Black Generation Xers\" are suffering \nthrough utter chaos. \"Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare \nAbusers...Images of My America\" is a collection of observations, \nand commentary as told through the eyes of a young African \nAmerican Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths \nthat many in \"Black America,\" and the world in general would have \nyou believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds \nlight on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of \n\"Mainstream American Society.\" A society that has nurtured the \nrampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many \nyoung African American men, and women currently suffer from. The \nwriter supports his arguments with direct references to the \noverwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to \nraise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish \ncriteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes \nbeing based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or \ncool neighborhood reputation.\n \nThe author also identifies the self-destructive and often \ncriminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily \nbasis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, \nrobbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing \nexpensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior \ncommitted by both males, and females is due in large part to a \nlack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless \nhomes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with \nthe unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in \nthe form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations \nare the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack \nof direction that currently exists in young \"Black America\" \ntoday.
