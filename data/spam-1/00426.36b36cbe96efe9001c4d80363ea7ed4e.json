Why pay more than you have to pay?\n\nWe can guarantee you the best rate and the best\ndeal possible for you. But only if you act now.\n\nThis is a free service. No fees of any kind.\n \nYou can easily determine if we can help you in\njust a few short minutes. We only provide\ninformation in terms so simple that anyone can\nunderstand them. We promise that you won't need\nan attorney to see the savings.\n \nWe offer both first and second home loans and we\nwill be happy to show you why your current loan\nis the best for you. 0r why you should replace\nit.\n\nOnce again, there's no risk for you. None at all.\n\nTake two minutes and use the link(s) below that\nworks for you. Let us show you how to get more\nfor yourself and your family. Don't let\nopportunity pass you by. Take action now.\n\n<a href=\"http://n62.go2net.com/adclick?cid=180713&site=dp&cp=nbci&clickurl=http://211.167.74.101/mortg/\">Click_Here</a>\n\nhttp://n62.go2net.com/adclick?cid=180713&site=dp&cp=nbci&clickurl=http://211.167.74.101/mortg/\n \nSincerely,\n\nChalres M.
