Of course it does. You most likely have\njust seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).\nAnd reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -\nNew Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when\nshe came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried\nbeneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old\nsons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when\nshe opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,\nfifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.\n\n\"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank\", says the 41-year-old\nwoman, \"There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my\nhusband earns in a year\".\n\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where\nhe worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away\nand they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\nactually finding it in the closet.\n\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of \n\"Report\" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\ncomputer in his bedroom.\n\n\"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name\non it like the instructions said and I started sending it out\", says the clever\n15-year-old.\n\nThe E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one\n$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top\nand move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to\nthe top of the list.\n\nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your\nname at the top of the 5-address list. \"I get junk E-mail all the time, and\nreally did not think it was going to work\", the boy continues.\n\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box\nthat his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions\nbegan to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.\n\n\"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\nyellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I\nwas in trouble or something (laughs)\". He goes on, \"I went up to the\ncounter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back\nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all\".  Over\nthe next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.\"  The\nmoney just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the\ncloset, barely had time for my homework\".He had also been riding his bike\nto several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, \nfifties and hundreds.\n\n\"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the\nlady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the\nmoney] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a\nreally strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me\nand my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next\nbank down the street (laughs).\"  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any\nreason to be afraid.The reporting news \n\nteam examined and investigated the so-called \"chain-letter\" the boy was\nsending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was\ncompletely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,\nSection 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in\nthe code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which\nstate a product or service must be exchanged for money received.\n\nEvery five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,\n\"Please send me report number XYX\".This simple note made the letter\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a \nfive-dollar fee.\n\n[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how\nthe system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What \nappears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -\n YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nBE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you\nsay \"Bull\", please read the following. This is the letter you have been\nhearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the\n Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire\nshow to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really\ncan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the\nprogram was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are\n\"absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if\npeople can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some\nmegabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost\".\n\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS\nPROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER\nTHAN EVER.\n\n\nNote* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when\nI hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.\n\nIn order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so\nthat the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the\nfollowing company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money\nfor reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.\n\nThis is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was \napproached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I\nfinally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal\neffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total\n$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in\".\n\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nHere is another testimonial: \"This program has been around for a long time \nbut I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the\nmail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions\nand walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I\nonly made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of\n$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I\nhave made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to\nsuccess in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change\nanything.\" More testimonials later but first,\n\nPRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE\n\n++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE \nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the\nperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.

DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a\ndisk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing\nyour business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you\nwith invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk\ne-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much\nmore. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:\n\n\nMETHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will\nassume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let's\nalso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response\ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people\nwill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\n\n\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10\npeople responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.\nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals\n100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.\nThe 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.\n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\norders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES\n$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:\n1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......\nGrand Total=$555,550.00\n\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT\nTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU\nCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment\nwhat would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people\nmailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on \nthe Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just\nthat, and more!\n\n\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of\nFREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will\neasily get a larger response.\n\n\nWe strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as\nyou go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the\nReport they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all\norders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name\nand address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they\nreceive the report.\n\n=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always\nsend $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT\naccepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2\nsheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write\nthe NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL \nADDRESS and your name and postal address.\n\n\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nREPORT #1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net\n\nOrder Report #1 from:\nR.

My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an\naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.\nWhen I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \n\"junk mail\". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the\npopulation and percentages involved. I \"knew\" it wouldn't work. Jody\ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in\nwith both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old \n\"I told you so\" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on\nme! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45\ndays she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.\nI have joined Jody in her \"hobby\".\n\nMitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my\nmind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that\nthe initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I\nwouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back\". \"I was\nsurprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with\norders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about\nthis deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big\".\n\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\"I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I\nshould have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone\nelse......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete\nthis one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money\ncame within 22 weeks\".\n\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this program, contact the Office\nof Associate Director for Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,\nBureau of Consumer Protection, Washington,D.C.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis email was sent to you via Saf-E Mail Systems.
