I know I did - many times! However,\nplease take a few moments to read this letter.\nI was amazed when the profit potential of this\nbusiness finally sunk in... and it works!\n\nWith easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,\nsuccess in this business is now fast, easy and\nwell within the capabilities of ordinary people\nwho know little about internet marketing. And the\nearnings potential is truly staggering!\n\nI'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -\nfollow what it says to the letter - and you will not\nworry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is\nPresident, or whether you keep your current job or not.\nYes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded\nto one of these before either. One day though,\nsomething just said: \"You throw away $25.00 going to\na movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.\"\nBelieve me, no matter where you believe those \"feelings\"\ncome from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. \n\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be\ndoing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.\nIt is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying\nand selling something of value.\n\nAS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:\n\nMaking over half a million dollars every 4 to 5\nmonths from your home.\n\nTHANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!\n==================================================\nBE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!\n\nBefore you say \"Bull\", please read the following.\nThis is the letter you have been hearing about on the\nnews lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on\nthe internet, a national weekly news program recently\ndevoted an entire show to the investigation of this\nprogram described below, to see if it really can make\npeople money. The show also investigated whether or\nnot the program was legal.\n\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are\n\"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in\nthe program and if people can 'follow the simple\ninstructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks\nwith only $25 out of pocket cost\".\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT\nTHIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING\nBETTER THAN EVER.\n\nThis is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this\nprofitable opportunity. I was approached many times\nbefore but each time I passed on it. I am so glad\nI finally joined just to see what one could expect\nin return for the minimal effort and money required.\nTo my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00\nin 21 weeks, with money still coming in.\"\n\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\n==================================================\nAnother said: \"This program has been around for a\nlong time but I never believed in it. But one day\nwhen I received this again in the mail I decided\nto gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple\ninstructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the\nmoney started to come in. First month I only made\n$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made\na total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months\nby re-entering the program, I have made over\n$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to\nsuccess in this program is to follow the simple\nsteps and NOT change anything.\"\n\nMore testimonials later but first, =======\n\n==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n\nIf you would like to make at least $500,000 every\n4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the\nfollowing...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!\n\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND \nYOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====\n\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE\nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the\nperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.\nMAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP\nLEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.\n\n===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===\n===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save\nthem on your computer and resell them.\nYOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.\n\nWithin a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each\nof the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.\nSave them on your computer so they will be accessible\nfor you to send to the 1,000's of people who will\norder them from you.

This is critical to YOUR success.\n\n==================================================\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified\nlist of names, and save it on your computer.\nDO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.\n\nSave this on a disk as well just in case you lose\nany data. To assist you with marketing your business\non the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information\nwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,\nwhere to find thousands of free classified ads and\nmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get this\nventure going:\n\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n==================================================\n\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see\nhow it goes, and we will assume you and those involved\nsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume\nthat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)\nresponse (the response could be much better but let's\njust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send\nout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only\n5,000 each.\n\nContinuing with this example, you send out only\n5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\n10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded\nby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\nresponded with orders. That's 100 people who\nresponded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for\na total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to\nthat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\n\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a\ntotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%\nresponse is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each\nfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.\nThe 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\nReport # 5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00\n(half a million dollars).\n\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50\n+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000\n+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO\nMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\n==================================================\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think\nfor a moment what would happen if everyone or half\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\ne-mails each or more?\n\nThere are over 150 million people on the internet\nworldwide and counting, with thousands more coming\nonline every day. Believe me, many people will do\njust that, and more!\n\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n==================================================\n\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and\nthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.\nPlacing a lot of free ads on the internet will\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest\nyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you\ngo along. For every $5 you receive, all you must\ndo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.\nAlways provide same day service on all orders.\n\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,\nwith your name and address on it, will be prompt\nbecause they cannot advertise until they receive\nthe report.\n\n===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================\nThe reason for the \"cash\" is not because this is\nillegal or somehow \"wrong\". It is simply about time.\nTime for checks or credit cards to be cleared or\napproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one\ncan SEE there is money in the envelope and steal\nit before it gets to you.\n\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\nNotes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for\neach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at least\n2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of\npaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report\nyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your\nname and postal address.\n\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :\n==================================================\nREPORT # 1: \"The Insider's Guide To Advertising\nfor Free On The Net\"\nOrder Report #1 from:\n\nRobert Borowczyk\nul.

If you do not, continue advertising or\nsending e-mails until you do.\n\n** Once you have received 100 or more orders for\nReport # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is\nalready working for you, and the cash will continue\nto roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed\nin front of a different report.\n\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which\nreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO\nGENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS\nAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT\nto the income you can generate from this business !!!\n=================================================\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: \nYou have just received information that can give you\nfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, with\nNO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can\nmake more money in the next few weeks and months\nthan you have ever imagined. Follow the program\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.\nIt works exceedingly well as it is now.\n\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report\nafter you have put your name and address in\nReport #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as\ninstructed above. One of the people you send this\nto may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your\nname will be on every one of them. \n\nRemember though, the more you send out the more\npotential customers you will reach. So my friend,\nI have given you the ideas, information, materials\nand opportunity to become financially independent.\n\nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW !\n\n=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============\n\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in\nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.\nCorporation and I make pretty good money. When I\nreceived this program I grumbled to Jody about\nreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole\nthing, spouting my knowledge of the population\nand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.\nJody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and\nfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I made\nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\n'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. \n\nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had\nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she\nhad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!\nI was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.\"\n\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\n================================================\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several\nweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.\nBut conservative as I am, I decided that the initial\ninvestment was so little that there was just no way\nthat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get\nmy money back. I was surprised when I found my\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.\nI made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. \n\nThe nice thing about this deal is that it does not\nmatter where people live. There simply isn't a\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big.\"\n\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\n=================================================\n\"I had received this program before. I deleted it,\nbut later I wondered if I should have given it a try.\nOf course, I had no idea who to contact to get\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed\nagain by someone else......... 11 months passed then\nit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!\nI made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the\nmoney came within 22 weeks.\"\n\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\n=================================================\n\"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively\neasy money with little cost to you. I followed the\nsimple instructions carefully and within 10 days the\nmoney started to come in. My first month I made $20,\nin the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the\nthird month my total cash count was $362,840.00.\nLife is beautiful, Thanx to internet.\"\n\nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\n=================================================\n\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR\nROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM !\n\n=================================================\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this\nprogram, contact the Office of Associate Director\nfor Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,\nBureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.\n\nThis message is sent in compliance of the proposed\nbill SECTION 301, paragraph (a)(2)(C) of S. 1618. \n\n* This message is not intended for residents in the\nState of Washington, Virginia or California,\nscreening of addresses has been done to the best\nof our technical ability.\n\n*  This is a one time mailing and this list will\nnever be used again.\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
