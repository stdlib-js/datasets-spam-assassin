MICHAEL BUNDU. \nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. \nTel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236\nemail : mikebundu@rediffmail.com\nDear Sir/Madam\n\n\nSEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. \n\nPlease permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This\nis necessitated by my urgent need to reach a \ndependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange\nand unsolicited but I crave your indulgence \nand pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and one of \nthe close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of\nCongo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may \nhis soul rest in peace. \n\nDue to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in\nmy country, I and some of my colleagues were \ninstructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and\nammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred \nThousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel\ngroup. We were then given this money privately \nby the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other\nCabinet Members. But when President Kabila \nwas killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we\nwere schedule to travel out of Congo, We \nimmediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here\nin Congo for safe keeping. The security of the \nsaid amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and\nseizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava \n(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military\nPersonnel from our same tribe, by the new \nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President\nLaurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. \n\nIn view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who\ncan assist us to move this money out of my country \nas the beneficiary. \nWE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic\nCover to a security company in Europe in your \nname. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked\n''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it \nwill not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. \n\nOur inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from\nour lack of trust of our supposed good friends \n(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked\nwith the late President Kabila, immediately \nafter his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,\nthe information We gathered from an associate \nwho has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with\nyour sincere assistance, this transaction will \nbe properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two\nweeks. The said money is a state fund and \ntherefore requires a total confidentiality. \n\nWe would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this\nfund in Europe. This is because we are under \nrestricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in\norder not to lose this fund which we have worked \nso hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out\nof Congo, you can contact me through my email \naddresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal\ninformation to enable us discuss the \nmodalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.\n\nPlease note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's\nSecurity is Guaranteed if we follow the required \nguidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as\nsoon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist \nus. \n\nI must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the\nutmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily \nconfidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.\nThank you and God Bless. \nBest Regards \n\n\nCOL.
