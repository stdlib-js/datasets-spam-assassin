Siden\nKrondikesvagen 54 A\n83147 Ostersund\nSweden\n________________________________________________\nEND OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************\n\nStep 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these\nGuides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be\nordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and\nyou will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.\n\nStep 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and\naddress of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that\nslot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's\nslot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.\nCheck the address again.\n\nStep 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and\nreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.\n\nStep 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and\nreplace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.\n\nStep 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and\nreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.\n\nStep 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and\nreplace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This\nstep is how your own name and address is entered into the\nlist of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,\nyour own name will go down the list of names until you have\nreached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The\nkey point is that the number of people ordering Guides from\nyou will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.\n\nStep 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out\nthis new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to\nas many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000\nemails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings\nyou make, potentially the greater the number of people who\nwill order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then\nmake new emails to send out to their addresses with the email\nshowing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.\n\nThis is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of\nthis email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps\nshown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as\nmany emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help\nthose who purchase the Guides from you to send out\nemails of their own.\n\nDo NOT change anything other than what is instructed.\nBecause if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate\nreaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list\nwith the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.\nThat might seem to you like a clever move because new\nbuyers will be sending their money to these people.  But\nthat move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.\nWhat will benefit you most is having people who will send\nout emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new\nbuyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to\nbe sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by\neffectively closing down the program with your name on\ntop of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There\nwouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver\nwill gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done\nthe work, and your name has worked its way to further\ndown the list, by then you deserve the rewards and\nearnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for\nanyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't\ndo it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!\n\nYou may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to\nthe five people on the list that one of the people will just\ntake your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest\nassured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you\nas a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find\nnew buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to\ncheat you or to \"stiff\" you for $10.00.  The people on the list\nwould rather have you working hard because your effort will\nbenefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send\nyou the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal\nby sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.\nProvide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.\n******END OF SUMMARY************************\n\n=======REST OF MESSAGE======================\n\nWith easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in\nthis business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary\npeople who may not have done any internet marketing before.\nAnd the earnings potential is staggering!\n\nREAD THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -\nfollow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a\nRECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can\nafford to buy that new car or home that you have been\nlooking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never\nresponded to one of these before either. One day though,\nsomething made me feel: \"You use $50 going to a movie\nfor 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple\nmeat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?\"  No matter where\nyou believe those \"feelings\" came from, I thank every day\nthat feeling came over me.\n\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing\nhad I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,\nYouï¿½ll learn how to become a more effective communicator.\nWhat can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and\nconfidence and at the same time have the potential to recover\nyour investment and make some good money: making over\nhalf a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.\nIf you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct\nmarketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing\nvia the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done\nin the future, then the experience you will gain here could\nbe a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing\na new career for you.\n\n= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =\n\nIf you want to make serious money, read this message until\nyou understand it completely and feel confident to follow\nthrough on what it advises.\n\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND\nYOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!\n\nRemember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,\nit will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You\nare offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such\nand you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period\nof time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and\nthe others on the list of five.\n\n===========================================\n*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,\nand save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER\nCHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:\n\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY\n===========================================\n\nLet's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that\nyou and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.\nLet's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%\n(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better\nbut let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will\nsend out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only\n5,000 each.\n\nOut of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only\n5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also\nsend out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of\nthose 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.\nThat's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.\n\nThose 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders\nfor Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each\nfor a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response\nis 625 orders for Guide # 4.\n\nThose 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total\nof 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125\norders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This\nmay seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a\nvery low response rate with a small number of emails being\nsent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate\nup just slightly.\n\nIf Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:\n$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)\n\nIf Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:\n$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795\n\nIf Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:\n$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100\n\nDare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone\nor half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\nemails each or more?  From the example above, you can see\nthe power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the\namount of money from a small increase in the response rate.\n\nThere are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide\nand counting, with thousands more coming online every day.\n\nMETHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n===========================================\n\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are\nMany FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on\nthe internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start\nwith  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.\nFor every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the\nGuide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.\n\nThe people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise\nyou how to get the large number of email addresses that\nyou need to send the new email containing your name and\naddress.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,\nyou also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to\ntheir email addresses.  This will benefit you because your\nname would be further down the list, and their new buyers\nwill buy from you.  This is no different than \"customer\nservice\" in the retail or the  \"bricks and mortars\" business.\n\n===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============\nThe reason for the \"cash\" is not because this is illegal or\nsomehow  \"wrong\". It is simply about time. Time for checks\nor credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it\nis simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope\nand steal it before it gets to you.\n\nORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\nAlways send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each\nGuide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden\nby wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of\nthose sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME\nof the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS\nand your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the\nenvelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to\nmail the envelope.\n\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW\nFROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN\nAT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL\n________________________________________________\nYOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES\n\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1\nwithin 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.\n\n=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,\nyou should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If\nnot, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.\n\nOnce you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,\nYOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and\ncash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT\nTO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice\nand instruction on how to send out more emails. You can\nKEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people\nare ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE\nMORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS\nAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.\nThere is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!\n===========================================\nA NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:\nYou have just received information that can give you\nfinancial freedom to really change your life, but I don't\nwish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You\ncan make more money in the next few weeks and months\nthan you have ever imagined. Follow the program\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.\n\nRemember to email the revised copy of this email after you\nhave put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved\nothers to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the\npeople you send this to may send out 100,000 or more\nemails and your name will be on every one of them.\nRemember, the more you send out the more potential\nbuyers you will reach.\n\nIT IS UP TO YOU!
