The original values of these \ncontracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum\nof US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand \nUnited\nState Dollars). This amount has now been approved and\nis now ready to be transferred being that the\ncompanies\nthat actually executed these contracts have been\nfully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. \n\n\nConsequently, my colleagues and I are willing to \ntransfer the total amount to your account for\nsubsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants\nare prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil\nservice law) from operating and/or opening foreign \naccounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust\nreposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in \nreturn, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the \ntransferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for\nincidental expenses (internal and external) between\nboth parties in the course of the transaction you will\nbe mandated to remit the balance to other accounts\nin due course. \n\nModalities have been worked out at the highest level\nof the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of \nNigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds\nwithin 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of\nthe above stated terms. \nOur assurance is that your role is risk free. To \n\naccord this transaction the legality it deserves and\nfor mutual security of the funds the whole approval\nprocedures will officially and legally processed\nwith your name or the name of any company you may\nnominate as the bonefide beneficiary. \nOnce more I want you to understand that having put\nin over twenty-five years in the civil service of my\ncountry, I am averse to having my image and career \ndented. This matter should therefore be treated with\nutmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. \n\nPlease you should signify your intention to assist\nby sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this\ntransaction, if favorable we will take further steps\nto brief you the full details of this viable \ntransaction. \nI want to assure you that this business proposal is\n100% risk free as we have done our homework\nproperly. \n\nI quite believe that you will protect our interest\nby taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are\nstill in government service, which we intend to\nretire from in full honor.\n\nKindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to\nenable us include this transfer in the next batch\nwhich would constitute the new quarter payments\nfor the 2002 financial year. \n\nThank you and God bless.\n\nDr James Alabi\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
