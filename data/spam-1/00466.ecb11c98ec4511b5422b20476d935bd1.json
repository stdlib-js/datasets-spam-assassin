I am a native of KONOBO in the\nKEREMA\nlocal district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.\nMUNDI A.\nKOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul\nKoromah\nbecause he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining\nCorporation\nof Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he \ninstructed me\nand my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,\nbefore the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)\nforces\nintervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children\nand I\nmanaged to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came\ninto\nTogo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE\nMILLION\nUNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited\nwith a\nTrust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the\ncurrier\ncompany who will freight the money to your country.\nMeanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in\nyour\ncountry because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the\nfuture of\nmy children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the\nTrust\nCompany in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be\ndeposited\ninto your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to\nsource for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your\ncountry when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.\nWe have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have\nresolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I\nam being\nmonitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice\nyou to\nhave the \ndeal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this\nemail:\nibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us\nproceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring\nsame into\nyour account.\nYour private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private\ndiscussions. \nNote: There is no risk involved in this business. \nRemain Blessed, \nMRS. ANNE  KOJO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
