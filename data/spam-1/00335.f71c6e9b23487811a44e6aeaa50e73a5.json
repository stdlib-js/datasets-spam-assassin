Fortunate for me, my main business\nslowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for\nsomething to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my\nbills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this\nproposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because\nI had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I don�t regret\nat all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as\na system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join\nonly if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your\ntime and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of\npersonal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simply\nthe most logical, opened, and fair of any others that I�ve seen before. Why?\nBecause from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously\nconsider if this is right for you.� No teasing. No grand testimonies! No\nkidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you �no idea� of\ntheir overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst\nyet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to\nfigure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you\nwith the two things you really must know: �<u>What�s it all about</u>?� and �<u>How\ndoes it work</u>?�. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that\nneed to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you don�t\nwant to do that; by then you are �hooked� and now locked into a frustrating\nbattle to try to get your money back! </b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my �Platinum\nChoice� because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally\ndifferent from previously misleading, �hook-first� programs that promise lofty\nmega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own\npockets! You�ve seen the headlines: �<u>Join free and Make $10,000 every week\nfor life</u>� yeah, right!</p>\n\n<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,\nbut the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy\nwith my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldn�t be able to do anything\nwithout corporate help � which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p>\n\n<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in action\nfor yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the\nform as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you\nare ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and\nthe Internet�s explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free\ncorporate help, on-time member�s support and even protective safeguards! </p>\n\n<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Get it now, and you can call me\nat any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to\nfinally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free.� Good luck!</p>\n\n<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><a\nhref=\"http://www.mindupmerchants.com/default.asp?ID=5581\">http://www.mindupmerchants.com/default.asp?ID=5581</a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Ben Green, (775) 322-3323 </p>\n\n<p class=MsoBodyText>P.S.Free POP3 email is ofered for members now!</p>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n\n------000000000000000000000--\n"}
