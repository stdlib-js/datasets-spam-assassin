I work about two hours a day.  \nI'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over \n$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?\n\nIn a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,\nit's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...\n\nYou've probably heard stories about people making\nwhopping huge money online, but you thought they \nwere the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or\nboy-geniuses.\n\nWell, grasshopper, think again ...\n\nIt's people like you and me that are making the real\nmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!\n\nEver since the \"dot com bubble\" burst in 1999, small-time\nentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 \ncompanies look for bankruptcy lawyers.\n\nToday small business owners and ordinary folks \nlike you and me can use the web to achieve complete \nfinancial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little \nwork.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing \ntechnique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.\n\nIf you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then \nyou know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on \nDELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?\nYou might not want their product, but remember that \nthousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a \npercentage game - every bulker who contacts you \nmakes a six figure income on the Internet.  I \nguarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and \nreview some numbers ...\n\nIf you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few\ndollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one\nauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a\ncouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand\nover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN\nSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY\nat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000\nemails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.\nZERO!\n\nStop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when\nhardly anyone sees your ad!\n\nImagine that you have a decent product with a \nprofit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send \nan email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person \nin a thousand actually places an order, then you just \ngenerated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours \nof work.  \n\nIt's that simple ...\n\nAll you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A\nTHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.\n\nThe best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't \nmatter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student \nusing a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old \nexecutive working from an office building in New \nYork City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start \nbulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All \nit takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, \nand some basic familiarity with the Internet.\n\nI quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the \n\"Dot Com\" mania, and I've never looked back.  I \nstarted with no money, no product to sell, and only \nthe most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an \nopportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, \nI bought my own home - with CASH.  \n\nYou don't need any money.  You don't need a product.\nYou don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience\nwhatsoever is required.  \n\nIf you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that\nyou'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.\nSo what are you waiting for?!\n\nI'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer\nYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you\nwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.\n\nHere goes ...\n\nDo you have basic experience with the web? \nDo you have a computer and an Internet connection?\nDo you have a few hours each day of free time?  \nDo you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards \ncomplete financial freedom?  \n\nIf you answer YES to these questions, you could be\nmaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your \nhome.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats \nthe 9-5 daily grind!\n\nAll you need is ambition and commitment.  This\nis no \"get rich quick scheme\".  You have to work\nto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do \nit.\n\nYou're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  \nDon't worry, it's not!
