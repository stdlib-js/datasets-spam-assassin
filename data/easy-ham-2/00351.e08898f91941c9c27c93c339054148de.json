I made that list a long time ago, and certainly\ndidn't re-research it before posting it today.  So, I offer three\ncandidate explanations:\n\n1.  I muffed that part, the first time, and was talking through my hat.\n2.  SAP had a proprietary version licensed to SuSE at the time.\n3.  SAP still have one licensed to SuSE today.\n\nI'm not sure which applies.  #1 is certainly a good possibility.\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
