This\nworks fine for conveniently wandering around the network and to some of our\nexternal boxes - or did, until today. Suddenly, when one user (alfred) tries\nto ssh anywhere he's asked for a password. He says He changed nothing (don't\nthey all) but I do actually believe him. I used ssh-keygen to make new keys\nbut that didn't help. \n\nI created a new user alfio into whose home directory I copied alfred's .ssh\ndirectory - alfio can wander around free as a bird without being asked for a\npassword ever (except of course for the passphrase to load the identiy into\nthe agent).\n\nIn case there was something else in Alfred' environment, I copied .??* from\nalfred's home directory to alfio's, remembering to change ownership\nafterwards. Still alfio is as free as a bird.\n\nWe use only SSH2 with DSA keys. An extract from a ssh -v for alfio is below\n\ndebug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT\ndebug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password\ndebug1: next auth method to try is publickey\ndebug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa\ndebug1: input_userauth_pk_ok: pkalg ssh-dss blen 434 lastkey 0x80916f0 hint -1\ndebug1: ssh-userauth2 successful: method publickey\n\nand before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfio said:\n\n1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)\n\nwhereas with alfred the same segment of the debug log went\n\ndebug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT\ndebug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password\ndebug1: next auth method to try is publickey\ndebug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /nfshome/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa\ndebug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password\n\nand before starting this ssh attempt, ssh-add -l for alfred said:\n\n1024 07:4c:7c:90:0d:28:41:3a:95:c2:81:3d:ba:c4:3d:03 /home/alfred/.ssh/id_dsa (DSA)\n\n\nThis problem is definitely related to alfred as a user - it happens when he\nlogs in on differing workstations (all NFS mounting the same home\ndirectories) and the other users (including good old alfio) don't have any\nproblems.\n\n\nNiall\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
