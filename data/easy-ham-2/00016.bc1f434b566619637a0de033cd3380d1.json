Thanks for your suggestions.\n\nWell, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU\nfan.\n\nI bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stg�133.86)\nbut I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on.\nIt has 4 x 51/4\" drive bays and 6 x 3�\" drive bays so I should be ok for\nfuture upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work\non. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come\noff, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb\nscrews). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands\noff shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3\ndifferent speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box\nis big and has loads of room inside.\nOh... and it looks very cool :-)\n\nHowever there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says\n\n* Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted!\n* ATX Power supply sold separately\n\nIn fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I\nordered 2 fans and a power supply separately.\nAlso the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the\nUSB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from\nthat show) but I missed that :-)\n\nI also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.\n(thanks Mike)\n\nSo now I can code-in-peace...\n\nJustin\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: ilug-admin@linux.ie [mailto:ilug-admin@linux.ie]On Behalf Of\n> Justin MacCarthy\n> Sent: Monday, August 12, 2002 12:56 PM\n> To: Ilug@Linux.Ie\n> Subject: [ILUG] PC Cases\n>\n>\n> Hi all, I have a Linux box at home that makes a god awful amount of noise.\n> Its a Athlon XP 1900+  with a  CoolerMaster fan.
