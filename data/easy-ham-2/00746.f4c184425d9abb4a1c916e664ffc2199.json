It was one of the\nworst disasters in American naval history; only 317 of its nearly 1,200\ncrew members survived.\n\nNow experts at Southwest Texas State University have given that tragic\nstory a startling new twist.\n\nIt was the moon, they say, that sank the Indianapolis. Or anyway, they\nwrite in the July issue of Sky & Telescope, it was the moon that made\nthe sinking possible.\n\nUsing astronomical computer programs, records and weather reports, as\nwell as the known coordinates and running speeds of the ship and the\nsubmarine that sank it, the authors determined that when the I-58\nsurfaced, it was perfectly aligned, west to east, with the cruiser. And,\nthey said, a three-quarter moon had just emerged from behind the clouds.\n\nLooking across the moonlit water, an I-58 crewman spotted the ship\nsilhouetted against the sky, 10.3 miles away. Half an hour later, six\ntorpedoes sent it to the bottom.\n\n\"It was sheer chance,\" said Dr. Donald Olson, an astronomer. \"Without\nthat alignment with the moon, the lookouts would not have spotted the\ncruiser, especially at that distance.\"\n\nWith Russell Doescher, a physics lecturer, Dr. Olson conducts a\nuniversity honors course called \"Astronomy in Art, History and\nLiterature.\" In the last 15 years, he has pinpointed the time and place\nof the rendering of art masterpieces, given new interpretations of\nastronomical references in Chaucer and revealed the decisive role of the\nmoon in military and other encounters.\n\nTwo years ago, for example, Dr. Olson turned his attention to the bright\nstar in van Gogh's \"White House at Night.\" He and some students went to\nAuvers, France, where van Gogh created his final works, and searched\nuntil they found the house, largely unchanged. Sifting through letters\nfrom van Gogh to his brother, Dr. Olson found that the painting was\ncompleted in June 1890.\n\nNoting the orientation of the house in the painting, he determined where\nvan Gogh had set his easel and what section of the sky he had portrayed,\nand from the lighting and shadows, he established that the house had\nbeen illuminated by the setting sun. His computer analysis then\nidentified the \"star.\" It was Venus, which in early evening in mid-June\nhad occupied that part of the sky.\n\nA final check of local weather records pinpointed the actual date van\nGogh had composed the painting, June 16, the only clear day in the\nmiddle of the month that year.\n\nDr. Olson has also turned his attention to Shakespeare, intrigued by the\nopening of \"Hamlet,\" when guards on the ramparts of Elsinor refer to the\n\"star that's westward from the pole had made his course to illume that\npart of heaven where now it burns.\" From the guards' description, the\nseason and the time, other astronomers had suggested several bright\nstars as possibilities, but Dr. Olson's calculations placed it in the\nconstellation Cassiopeia, which lacks any notably luminous stars.\n\nPondering this problem on a trip with his wife, Dr. Olson was suddenly\ninspired. He was aware that in 1572, a supernova, called Tycho's star,\nfor the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, suddenly flamed in Cassiopeia,\ncreating a worldwide sensation. Shakespeare, 8 at the time, would\ncertainly have recalled the event, and his memory was probably refreshed\nby the description of the supernova in a history book that was the\nsource of some of his best-known plays.\n\nDr. Olson has no doubt that the star that glared above Elsinor that\nnight was Tycho's, and he has an impressive record of other\nastronomy-based sleuthing.\n\nAware that the photographer Ansel Adams often neglected to date his\nnegatives, Dr. Olson set out to find when Adams had shot his classic\n\"Moon and Half Dome.\" At Yosemite, Dr. Olson and his students found\nAdams's vantage point, studied the location, phase and features of the\nmoon in the photograph, plus the shadows on the Dome, snow on the peak\nand other clues, and then announced that the picture had been taken at\n4:14 p.m., Dec. 28, 1960.\n\nThen, Dr. Olson calculated that the setting would be virtually identical\nat 4:05 p.m. on Dec. 13, 1994. On that day Adams's daughter-in-law\nvisited Yosemite and was photographed holding a print of \"Moon and the\nHalf Dome\" in the foreground of an eerily similar view of the actual\nmoon and the Half Dome.\n\nAnalyzing Chaucer's works, Dr. Olson has confirmed that a particularly\nrapid movement of the moon described in \"The Merchant's Tale\" occurred\nin April 1389. And in \"The Franklin's Tale,\" Chaucer's description of\nthe heavenly alignment that caused an exceptionally high tide on the\nBrittany coast, convinced Dr. Olson that Chaucer was an advanced amateur\nastronomer.\n\nThen there was Paul Revere. On his way to saddle up for his famous ride,\nhow did he manage to row undetected past a British warship on a moonlit\nnight in Boston Harbor? Dr. Olson's computer program revealed that,\nwhile the moon was nearly full that night, it was unusually close to the\nsouthern horizon and did not illuminate Revere's boat.\n\nDr. Olson's proudest achievement was explaining \"the tide that failed\"\nin the bloody Marine Corps landing at Tarawa atoll on Nov. 20, 1943.\nPlanners had expected a tide to provide a water depth of five feet over\na reef some 600 yards from shore, allowing larger landing craft, with\ndrafts of at least four feet, to pass.\n\nBut that day and the next, in the words of some observers, \"the ocean\njust sat there,\" providing neither low tide nor high tide and leaving a\nmean depth of three feet over the reef. The craft grounded on the edge\nof the reef, and many marines were killed or injured as they waded 600\nyards to the shore, rifles over their heads, in the face of machine-gun\nfire from the Japanese.\n\nAsked by a former marine about the tidal phenomenon, Dr. Olson spent six\nmonths researching and mastering tidal theory and discovered that the\nmilitary planners were aware that they had to contend with a \"neap\"\ntide. This phenomenon occurs twice a month when the moon is near its\nfirst or last quarter, because the countering tug of the sun causes\nwater levels to deviate less.\n\nBut that day, the moon was also almost at its farthest point from earth\nand exerted even less pull, leaving the waters relatively undisturbed\nand the marines in trouble.\n\n\"I'm not in the least blaming the planners,\" Dr. Olson said, explaining\nthat the techniques used in accurately determining tides hadn't been\napplied to the waters at Tarawa.\n\nIndeed, he modestly claims, by using his computer program, \"We can\ncalculate the tides in any port in the world on any day in history.\"\n\nYet Dr. Olson's greatest satisfaction seems to stem from his\ninterdisciplinary approach to astronomical sleuthing. \"I have thought\nabout van Gogh, about Shakespeare and Chaucer,\" he says, \"and that has\nmade my life as a scientist much richer.\"\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
