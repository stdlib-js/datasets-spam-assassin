If you\nhave some law that prevents action against spammers, then why all the\nclass-action suits and other anti-spam court cases, some even\nstate-funded?\n\nI'm also curious of the mechanics of your retribution strategy: Let's\nsay you did win a lawsuit and shut down the largest spammer network in\nthe USA, do you really believe 40 Beijing spammers won't fill the\nvoid?  Do you really believe those 40 are not right now prepping their\nmail servers whether or not you prevail over your countrymen? How do\nyou intend to take legal (and/or violent) action against people a\nworld away and in a culture you can barely understand let alone\nunderstand how to properly bribe?  \n\nI'm not so hopeful this method can work against aromatherapy viagra\nwhen we can't even track and convict murderous Nigerian mafia, and\nthey are blatant!  Political solution is a contradiction in terms, and\nit's also true that no lawmaker has ever been even a tenth the\ncatalyst on improving the quality of life in Britain and the western\nworld as did central heating and the invention of one A.J.Crapper.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\nBusiness Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com\n\"Computers are useless.
