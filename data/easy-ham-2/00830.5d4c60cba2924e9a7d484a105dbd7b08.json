Worse, only 22%\nof the respondents understood what a molecule - for example, carbon dioxide\n- is.\n\nAs in the case of the belief by many that dinosaurs and early humans\nco-existed, public opinion does not change the actual facts about the\nmaterial world. Such a poll measures nothing more than the degree of public\nignorance about scientific matters.\n\nMost people get news stories about science and technology developments from\ntelevision. And after more than a decade of being fed what-if stories about\nglobal warming from human activities, no wonder most people \"believe\" that\nglobal warming \"will\" occur. However, on the anxiety scale, only 33% \"worry\na great deal\" about global warming, a worry that ranks at 12 out of 13\nenvironmental concerns. The top environmental fear, shared by 64% of those\npolled, was polluted drinking water.\n\nSo What Do We Know?\n\nConcerning the latest understanding on human-made global warming, here are\nthree points we know from the science:\n\n   1. The surface record of temperature from thermometers show widespread\nwarming in the 20th century compared to the 19th. There was one period of\nwarming early in the 20th century, the second after the 1970s. Ecosystems\nhave responded to this widespread warmth, not seen since ca. 800 - 1200 C.E.\n\n      But the cause of global surface warming cannot be associated with\nhuman activity without additional information. Some media reports point to\necosystem responses of 20th century warmth (e.g., mountain glacier retreat)\nand unjustifiably claim the responses owe to man-made causes. But mountain\nglaciers receded during the past period of warmth around 1,000 years ago,\nand advanced during the unusual cold of the Little Ice Age (ca. 1300 - 1900\nC.E.). Both those climate shifts occurred naturally, before the increased\nconcentration of human-made greenhouse gases in the air.\n\n\n    # All computer simulations of climate say that in order to conclude\nthat the surface global warming trend is human caused, the surface warmth\nmust be accompanied by an equal or larger warming trend in the air from one\nto five miles in height. Measurements made by satellites and verified from\nweather balloons show no meaningful human-made warming trend over the last\ntwo or even four decades. Thus, the recent warming trend in the surface\ntemperature record cannot be caused by the increase of human-made\ngreenhouse gases in the air.\n\n\n    # The computer simulations are not reliable as tools for explaining\npast climate or making projections for future trends.\n\n\n\nFuture Shock: The Scenarios\n\nWhen it comes to future scenarios, consider what the experts actually say\nabout potential climate change. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change writes in its Special Report on Emissions Scenarios\n(2000), \"Scenarios are images of the future or alternative futures. They\nare neither predictions nor forecasts.\" Further, \"The possibility that any\nsingle emissions path will occur as described in the scenario is highly\nuncertain,\" and finally, \"No judgement is offered in this Report as to the\npreference for any of the scenarios and they are not assigned probabilities\nof occurrence, neither must they be interpreted as policy recommendations.\"\n\nForecasting future societal conditions and energy use often amount to\nlittle more than unconvincing guesses. Jesse Ausebel at Rockefeller\nUniversity in April 2002 critiqued the U.N. IPCC's \" ... 40 energy\nscenarios, with decarbonization, or carbonization, sloping every which way\nand no probabilities attached. ... It is a confession that collectively\nthey know nothing, that no science underlies their craft, and that politics\nstrongly bias their projections.\"\n\nNonetheless, such a guess about the world's energy future forms the first\nstep in making a 100-year prediction of global warming. That first\nuncertain forecast - future energy use - used as input in the climate\nsimulation surely compounds the uncertainty in the next step, the climate\nforecast.\n\nInability to predict the future should not be surprising. The climate\nsimulations upon which predictions are based yield unreliable results\nbecause, as outlined above, the results are incompatible with measurements\nof how the climate has changed in the last few decades.\n\nComplete Speculation\n\nOn May 24, 1994, Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of\nMeteorology at MIT, testified to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural\nResources, \"The claims about catastrophic consequences of significant\nglobal warming, should it occur at all, are almost completely speculative.\nNot only are they without any theoretical foundations, but they frequently\ninvolved assuming the opposite of what appears to happen.\"\n\nDespite years of solid work by climate specialists, the output of computer\nsimulations remains undependable, owing to the extraordinary complexity of\nthe natural world. Thus, on May 1, 2001 Lindzen testified to the Senate\nCommerce Committee about the long-standing inability of computer\nsimulations to deliver results that resemble reality, even in the cases\nwhere good measurements are available:\n\n\"For example, there is widespread agreement [among climate scientists] ...\nthat large computer climate models are unable to even simulate major\nfeatures of past climate such as the 100 thousand year cycles of ice ages\nthat have dominated climate for the past 700 thousand years, and the very\nwarm climates of the Miocene [23 to 5 million years ago], Eocene [57 to 35\nmillion years ago], and Cretaceous [146 to 65 million years ago]. Neither\ndo they do well at accounting for shorter period and less dramatic\nphenomena like El Ninos, quasi-biennial oscillations, or intraseasonal\noscillations - all of which are well documented in the data, and important\ncontributors to natural variability.\"\nLindzen explained the failure of computer simulations simply in May 2000:\n\n\"The point I am making is that it is a fallacious assumption that the\nmodels have everything in them, and will display it, and somehow the rest\nis just technical uncertainty. There are things they literally don't have.\"\nThis punctuates the popular notion that averaging output from computer\nresults will somehow, miraculously, give a scientifically appropriate\nresult.\n\nThink Locally\n\nNow, on top of the unreliable forecasts of global warming -- which rest on\n\"highly uncertain\" forecasts of future economic and social conditions and\nun-validated climate simulations -- come the forecasts of local impacts, in\norder to make the case for relevancy to people. Increased storminess is one\nprediction of the outcome of human-made global warming found in the popular\nmedia, which would be where most people learn about the issue.\n\nThe idea that storminess increases with human-made global warming defies\nexpert opinion. David Legates, an expert hydrology researcher, testified in\nthe Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on March 13, 2002:\n\n\"Ascertaining anthropogenic changes to these extreme weather events is\nnearly impossible. Climate models cannot even begin to simulate storm-scale\nsystems, let alone model the full range of year-to-year variability...\nClearly, claims that anthropogenic global warming will lead to more\noccurrences of droughts, floods, and storms are wildly exaggerated.\"\nThe U.N. IPCC Third Assessment Report concurs, \"[T]here is currently\ninsufficient information to assess recent trends, and climate models\ncurrently lack the spatial detail required to make confident projections.\nFor example, very small-scale phenomena, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes,\nhail and lightning, are not simulated in climate models (Summary for\nPolicymakers, p. 15).\"\n\nA group of extremely relevant experts, the American Association of State\nClimatologists, recently summarized the state of climate simulations:\n\n\"Climate prediction is complex with many uncertainties ... For time scales\nof a decade or more, understanding the empirical accuracy of such\npredictions - called \"verification\" - is simply impossible, since we have\nto wait a decade or longer to assess the accuracy of the forecasts. ...\nclimate predictions have not demonstrated skill in projecting future\nvariability and changes in such important climate conditions as growing\nseason, drought, flood-producing rainfall, heat waves, tropical cyclones\nand winter storms. These are the type of events that have a more\nsignificant impact on society than annual average global temperature\ntrends.\"\nOn the facts of human-made global warming, should one believe television or\nthe experts?\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
