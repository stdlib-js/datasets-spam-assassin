LOL  So who is it again who's on \nthis list who's associated with Opera?  Why's the free one using the same \nLAME idea netzero, etc useD?   I know what kind of  costs are involved in \ncreating software like this, and I understand everyone needs to eat, but \nif someone can get netscape for free, and opera isn't free, then, hmmm...  \nI imagine this email is going to bring some bricks down on my head, but \nwell, go for it, I gots my helmet.
