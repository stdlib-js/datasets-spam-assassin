There are other brands and various\nother tape formats to choose from, but just to give you a rough\nbenchmark of pricing for that sorta capacity.\n\nTher are options that will go up to crazy capacities by using\nusing multiple tapes in a caddy... of course its gonna cost\na lot more.\n\nI'd also be ensuring I had some sort of disk mirroring set up\nalso... the more redundancy the better (within reason).\n\nG.\n\n___________________________\n Graham Smith,\n Network Administrator,\n Department of Computing,\n Institute of Technology,\n Tallaght, Dublin 24\n Phone: + 353 (01) 4042840\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Ciaran Johnston [mailto:cj@nologic.org]\nSent: 16 August 2002 15:09\nTo: ilug@linux.ie\nSubject: [ILUG] Backup solutions\n\n\nHi folks,\nI maintain a colocated server on behalf of a small group of individuals,\nand am looking at backup solutions. Is it possible to get some sort of low-\nend internal tape / other solution that could be used to back up approx. 40\nGigs of data or am I just dreaming? My ISP does offer backups at extra cost\nbut the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost.\n\nWhat I was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape device,\nthen swap tapes round every month, so I had an onsite backup of say the\nlast 24 hours and an offsite backup of the last month. Is this feasible?\nI'm beginning to think it isn't. External devices are not an option as part\nof the charge for colocation is rackspace.\n\nThanks,\nCiaran.\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
