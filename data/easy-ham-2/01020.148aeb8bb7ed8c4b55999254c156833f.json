Stealing my $1,000 sterio\nand then fencing it for $50 does not result in 'no loss' the the economy\noverall.  For the same reason that voluntary transactions increase\nsocial value, involuntary ones decrease it.  If the sterio was worth as\nmuch to the theif as it was to me he'd buy it ...\n\nOn the flip side of this, common law allows a breach of property law in\nprecisely the type of scenarios where a net social gain is recorded but\nthe owner's availability to make a contract was problematic.  Breaking\ninto your isolated cabin because I'm starving, for example, is\npermissible if I later offer restitution for the damage I caused and the\nfood I ate.\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\n> Russell Turpin\n> Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2002 6:25 AM\n> To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org\n> Subject: Re: David Friedman: Mail Me the Money!\n> \n> R.
