So FreeBSD's ipfw is not encumbered in the same way the old\nOBSD firewalling was?\n\n> Perhaps, although I think when seriously considering something like\n> a firewall, tried and trusted means a hell of a lot.

(i've one that has crashed twice \nnow after 60+ day uptimes. but that doesnt seem to be netfilter).\n\ncourse, there's a lot more that can go wrong with a firewall than the\nfirewall code. in that case get 2 boxes and heartbeat them.\n\n> I was talking in terms of the actual firewall.

(closest i've come is looking at IPFilter \nfor IRIX - but it had a problem in that it wasnt maintained \nanymore. however, while the englishy syntax is nice, i dont think \niptables command <args> syntax is a big obstacle).\n\nanyway.. there's choice. and as i understand it, with the advent of \nnetfilter/iptables there's now almost nothing between them from a \ntechnical POV. (apart from ipfw being in use a lot longer).\n\nregards,\n-- \nPaul Jakma\tpaul@clubi.ie\tpaul@jakma.org\tKey ID: 64A2FF6A\nFortune:\nWhat a strange game.
