He wanted to spade his potato garden,\nbut it was very hard work.\n His only son, who would have helped him, was in Prison. The old man  wrote\na  letter to his son and mentioned his predicament.\n Shortly, he received this reply, \"For heaven's sake Dad, don't dig up  that\ngarden, that's where I buried the GUNS!\"\n At 4 A.M. the next morning, a dozen police showed up and dug up the old\nman's entire garden, without finding any guns.\n Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what\nhappened, and asking him what to do next.\n His son's reply was: \"Now plant your potatoes, Dad. It's the best\nI could  do  at this time.\"\n\nbut better than that, just settle into this, courtesy of daypop:\nhttp://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG02/yeung/actioncomics/cover.html\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\nBusiness Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com\n\"Computers are useless.
