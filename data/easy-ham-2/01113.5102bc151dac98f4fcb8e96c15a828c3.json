You have multiple generations of\npeasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a\nhuman parts of the property package.\n\nThe problem in the Philippines is that the landowner class is fading,\nbut the peasants are still operating under the old economic assumption\neven though it isn't being imposed on them in most cases.  In a number\nof areas, you have landowners that don't use their lands during bad\nyears (i.e. when sugar prices fall too low or some other condition that\nmakes planting unprofitable in the global economy) and in some cases\nhave all but abandoned them, but when they come back to plant crops\nseveral years later they find the same peasants living on the fallow\nland as scratch farmers to survive and waiting for the landowner to come\nback and give them something to do.\n\nThe government's solution to this was to \"redistribute\" fallow land to\nthe peasants that lived on them, and created a number of problems in the\nprocess.  First of all, it meant that all the agricultural producers had\nto plant crops all the time (profitable or not) or the government would\nseize the land and give it to someone else, which is not economically\noptimal by any means.  Second when they give it to the peasants, they\nuse it to become scratch farmers, which is not a particularly productive\neconomic activity, and the landowners generally let them do that for\nfree when the land is fallow anyway.  Third, the peasants generally\n*prefer* to work for the landowner rather than own the land themselves;\nthey make more money, have more opportunities to become middle-class,\nand enjoy a better lifestyle under that arrangement.  So the result of\nall this is that the landowners either run an economically sub-optimal\nagriculture business to protect their lands, or they risk having their\nland seized without compensation and given to the peasants/squatters who\nwill gladly sell it back to the plantation owner rather than becoming\nscratch farmers, another economically sub-optimal solution. The only\nreal role of the government in this arrangement is to be a drag on the\neconomy.\n\nAnd I don't know about 20 years for land titles in the Philippines.  It\ntakes a little longer than in the US (though not much), and you may have\nto bribe someone to make it work well in an expedited manner, but it\nisn't that onerous in the regions I'm familiar with.\n\nSpeaking as a former Philippine plantation owner. (Yes, really. On\nNegros and Cebu. Have I led a strange life or what?)\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
