There are some\nadditional complications for some of the other architectures.\n(Essentially, they make most of the other architectures' ISO images\navailable gratis, because they aren't selling boxed sets and want the\npublic to have them anyway.  The ISOs include third-party proprietary\napps, but of necessity not the highly-restricted ones available in \nboxed set editions.)\n\n(1) You can get a single-disk ISO9660 image of SuSE \"evaluation\"\nedition, version 7.0, _lots_ of places, including here:\n\nftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/evaluation-7.0/evaluation-7.0.iso\n\n(2) You could \"wget -r\" (or equivalent) the entire 8.0 FTP Edition (for\nlack of an official name for it) from here (or mirror sites):\n\nftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/\n\nPlease note the restricted rights granted for use of the SuSE-originated\nYaST program specifically, stated here:\n\nftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/COPYRIGHT.yast\n\nA grant of limited redistribution rights to the distribution as a whole \n(apparently covering the FTP Edition and the Evaluation Edition) is\nstated here: ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/README.mirror-policy   Quoting:\n\n     please make sure that you meet the following conditions if\n     you intend to mirror ftp.suse.com:\n\n   - SuSE Linux (YaST in particular) may not be reproduced on\n     CDs or other media FOR VALUE. Reproduction for personal\n     or educational use is explicitly allowed and encouraged.\n\n> I'm not sure on the details of it, but I think SuSE have\n> probably done an OpenBSD of the cd they sell?\n\nOpenBSD Foundation assert a compilation copyright over the OpenBSD\nofficial ISO9660 image.  A compilation copyright is the copyright\nmonopoly that, for example, the editor of a set of third-party short\nstories receives.  Even though he didn't write any of the constituent\nstories, he put creative work into selecting, arranging, and editing\nthose stories.  The law recognises such efforts as creative works\ndeserving copyright protection, if there is sufficient creative effort.\n(A judge would decide, if someone made a court case of it.)  Courts have\nheld, on the other hand, that arrangement and publication of\nalphabetical telephone listings in a \"yellow pages\" telephone directory\n(the advertising section) don't have anywhere near enough creative\ncontent to support an overreaching telco's claim of compilation\ncopyright.  (The court politely said \"Nice try\", in effect.)\n\nThe OpenBSD Foundation's claim may be a bit of a legal bluff, too.\nTheoretically, one could get around it by creating a slightly different\nset of ISO9660 images, thereby finessing the claim of compilation\ncopyright.  But nobody bothers, because OpenBSD Foundation actually \ncharges only a very reasonable price for jewel-case sets, and nobody\nwants to endure the barrage of hatemail from Theo & co.\n\nI've never seen any claim from SuSE of compilation copyright on its ISOs\nor distribution as a whole.\n\n> I could be wrong, I don't use SuSE so haven't investigated,\n> but essentially the only 'free' version of SuSE will be it's\n> ftp offering.\n\nAgain, the \"FTP Edition\" and the Evaluation Edition may be redistributed\nmore-or-less freely, as long as it's not \"for value\".  (Ditto the\n\"live-eval\" edition, which is a demo only.)  The three boxed sets'\ncontents may not.\n\n-- \nCheers,              A good man has few enemies; a ruthless man has none.\nRick Moen                                       \nrick@linuxmafia.com\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
