But the young processor company and more than a dozen others\nlike it are anchored in the mainstream courtesy of the MIPS\ninstruction-set architecture. More and more, MIPS is becoming the choice\nfor maverick processor design teams seeking a place at the high end by\nfielding unorthodox devices. And if Motorola and IBM in the PowerPC camp\naren't careful, they could see their performance leadership in the\nhigh-end embedded-processor market snatched away by some of these upstarts.\n\nIn Austin, Texas, meanwhile, designers at another MIPS house, Intrinsity\nInc., aren't prepared to ditch the clock. But they are putting a new\nspin on some old tricks such as giving each gate its own clock and then\nletting them overlap. Using such sleight of hand, the company hopes to\nsoon deliver RISC-based processors that run at an eye-popping 2 GHz and\nconsume just 10 to 15 watts.\n\nFulcrum, Intrinsity and their brethren may once have been written off as\ninteresting experiments, backed by venture capitalists who overlooked\nsome of the finer details, like software compatibility. What lends them\nrespectability is MIPS.\n\nTheirs for the asking \n\nOne reason young processor companies seem to be flocking to the platform\nis that its steward, MIPS Technologies Inc., has no qualms about\nlicensing the instruction-set architecture (ISA), provided that the\nlicensee agrees to meet a software-compatibility test suite. By\ncontrast, processor-core rival ARM Ltd. has granted this privilege to\njust two of its many licensees, Intel and Motorola. And so far, the two\nPowerPC vendors, IBM Corp. and Motorola Inc., have rebuffed most\nrequests to license that architecture, with the notable exception being\nFPGA vendor Xilinx Inc., which has licensed the 405 PowerPC from IBM.\n\nThe MIPS ISA is also one of the simplest forms of\nreduced-instruction-set computing around, which tends to make it\nattractive to processor designers interested in extending the\narchitecture. It was this and the wide availability of tools and\nsoftware that drew Intrinsity to MIPS, even though the company is aiming\nat PowerPC sockets, as evidenced by its decision to adopt the RapidIO\ninterface instead of HyperTransport, which has been favored by MIPS vendors.\n\nGood fit \n\n\"It's a nice, clean architecture and has an open model that allows us to\nadd instructions,\" said Paul Nixon, chief executive officer of\nIntrinsity.  \"You also get all the third-party tools that very easily\nfit into our base of platforms.\"\n\nThere was a time when this openness was seen as a liability for MIPS. In\nthe mid-1990s, before MIPS was spun out from Silicon Graphics Inc., the\ninstruction set lacked a multiply-add instruction, so some MIPS vendors\ntook it upon themselves to create their own. The problem was that this\nbroke many of the development tools, causing headaches for compiler\nvendors like Green Hills Software Inc.\n\n\"We went to MIPS and said we have 20 different compiler variants and\nit's embarrassing,\" said Craig Franklin, vice president of engineering\nat Green Hills and a respected microprocessor industry veteran. Franklin\nalso wasn't shy about telling MIPS it needed to revamp its embedded\napplication binary interface. \"We went to MIPS and said we've done a\ndozen EABIs, let's clean up yours,\" he said.\n\nMIPS took the advice and wasted little time clamping down on\narchitectural deviations, observers said. But the MIPS camp still has to\nlive with a legacy of incompatible chips in the field. \"To its credit,\nMIPS quickly caught on,\" said Jim Turley, a microprocessor industry\nanalyst. \"Going forward, MIPS is maintaining good control but they are\nstill haunted by incompatibility among multiples.\"\n\nIf the biggest risk to the MIPS camp is fragmentation, then the PowerPC\ncamp has the opposite problem: architectural confinement. Though the\nPowerPC architecture carries the cachet of household names Motorola and\nIBM, these are essentially the only two companies that provide\nPowerPCs. It's not for lack of interest. Rather, the companies have been\nreluctant to cede control over the architecture. This could wind up\nhurting the PowerPC cause, though.\n\n\"To get a PowerPC license is impossible or very expensive,\" Green Hills'\nFranklin said. \"Tactically this may have been a mistake. If you're a\nJapanese company, all things being equal, you'd rather buy from another\nJapanese company.\"\n\nAnalyst Turley, too, thinks the PowerPC camp will only stand to gain by\nlicensing the architecture. \"It's all about software compatibility and\ntool support. The more you can proliferate the architecture the better\nyou're going to do,\" he said. \"I don't think Motorola and IBM can\naddress the entire market by themselves.\"\n\nThere's a chance that this could change. IBM, for its part, is in the\nprocess of planning an expansion strategy for PowerPC that may involve\nmore licensing. Though it's unlikely the PowerPC camp will ever have the\nopen licensing model of MIPS Technologies, MIPS processor vendors may\nhave more than just two competitors to worry about.\n\n\"We're certainly not averse to [licensing],\" said Lisa Su, director of\nPowerPC products at IBM. \"The question is, how much do we do and who do\nwe license to. There are various ways you could go, whether it's a hard\ncore, soft core or licensing the ISA.\"\n\nBut the fear of architectural fragmentation still looms large. \"We know\nthat if we have different microarchitectures we have to do work on\nsoftware compatibility,\" Su said. \"With MIPS there's a degree of\nfracturing. That may not always be a big problem, but if you go to other\nmarkets -- like consumer -- it becomes big. Our belief is there is a\nhappy medium.\"\n\nWhatever path IBM takes it will act in its own best interest as a chip\nprovider, not as a company that wants to hawk intellectual\nproperty. This is why the Xilinx licensing deal works for IBM: Big Blue\nis not so much interested in the royalties and fees it collects from\nXilinx, but in the dual benefit of widening the appeal of the\narchitecture and the revenue IBM generates from manufacturing the FPGAs\nfor Xilinx in its own fabs. \"We're not trying to make money off of\nlicensing,\" Su said.\n\nManufacturing is probably one of the most powerful weapons that PowerPC\nvendors IBM and Motorola wield. Both have gussied up their high-end\nlines with copper interconnect and silicon-on-insulator technology,\nstill rarities among chip makers. This has helped both companies design\nrelatively low-power embedded processors running at 1 GHz that are\nshipping today. IBM did it using 0.13-micron design rules and a\nfour-stage pipeline; Motorola is using 0.18-micron design rules and a\nseven-stage pipe.\n\nThe companies say there's more performance headroom in store. \"When we\nget to 0.13 micron we'll get substantially faster,\" said Raj Handa,\nPowerPC and PowerQuicc marketing manager at Motorola.\n\nProprietary processes \n\nMost MIPS processor vendors, by contrast, rely on mainstream foundries\nthat haven't developed the more-exotic process technologies. And even\nthough companies like Motorola are shifting more capacity to outside\nfoundries, they're keeping their special process recipes in-house to\njuice up their high-performance devices.\n\nLacking this capability, most MIPS processor vendors will have little\nchoice but to come up with dazzling architectural feats to keep up their\nchops at the high end. It should become clear in the next year or so how\nsome of the newer players measure up.\n\nIntrinsity hopes to field its 2-GHz processors by the end of the\nyear. Fulcrum is shooting for an early 2003 introduction. \"We're going\nto shock the industry in terms of raw performance and speed-vs.-power\nperformance,\" Fulcrum's Nunn said. \"We really want to change the way the\nworld designs semiconductors.\"\n\n\n\nhttp://www.fulcrummicro.com/press/article_fastco_04-02.shtml\n\nThe Pasadena startup machine\nBy Alison Overholt\nApril, 2002  \n\nThere was a time when every dorm room, it seemed, was a startup waiting\nto happen. Throughout the 1990s, kids cobbled together business plans\nbetween classes, won funding, and jumped into business. Risk? What risk?\nPlunging into a new venture seemed all too easy.\n\nAh, the fickleness of youth. These days, most of the kids are back in\nclass. Venture capitalists say that they're seeing precious few\nproposals out of MIT, Stanford, and almost every other university, save\none: the California Institute of Technology.\n\nIn fact, Caltech says that it actually spun out the same number of\nstartups in 2001 -- a poor time, needless to say, for new ventures -- as\nit did in the boom year of 1999. While startup enthusiasm has faded on\nmost campuses, Caltech has blossomed into a robust new-company machine.\n\nThis didn't happen by accident. During the past seven years, Caltech's\nOffice of Technology Transfer has carefully developed a strategy for\ncultivating commerce. \"We focus on nurturing entrepreneurs\nscientifically more than other schools do,\" says Rich Wolfe, the\noffice's associate director. That is, the university focuses more on the\nscience itself than on the ensuing commercial opportunity.\n\nThat's what grabbed Uri Cummings and Andrew Lines, two PhD students at\nCaltech who founded Fulcrum Microsystems in 2000. \"There is a pervasive\nphilosophy at Caltech that no problem is unsolvable,\" Cummings\nsays. \"There's a focus on scientific ingenuity that is thrilling to be\naround. Caltech has so many entrepreneurs because the school doesn't\nmake it about business or focus on how much money they'll get out of\nit. Caltech is a catalyst, moving technology from the university out\ninto industry, and students are thrilled to be a part of it.\"\n\nBefore starting Fulcrum, Cummings and Lines worked for six years with\nCaltech computer-science professor Alain Martin on an\nasynchronous-circuit design for semiconductor chips. They ventured into\ncommercialization while still in the throes of their doctoral program.\n\nThat they could afford to do that points to another, more practical\naspect to Caltech's approach. Other universities typically require\nentrepreneurs to pay up-front application and licensing fees for the use\nof technology patents. But Caltech believes that such payments stifle\nentrepreneurship, since young companies usually have little cash to\nspare. Instead, the school typically takes equity stakes in startups,\nand it defers collection of patent payments until fledgling companies\nare financially secure.\n\nFor Caltech, it's a long-term bet. \"The reality is that universities\nrely far more on their endowments than they could on any fees to be\ncollected from the initial licensing process,\" Wolfe says. \"So we seek a\nbite of the apple -- and we hope that if one of these entrepreneurs\nfounds the next Intel, he'll not only share the equity but also bestow a\ngift on the university in remembrance that we took care of him when he\nwas just getting started.\"\n\nCummings and Lines may be in a position to do just that. Fulcrum has won\nabout $20 million in venture funding amid the toughest venture market in\nrecent history. Its founders have hired a credible CEO, Bob Nunn, who\nformerly ran Vitesse's telecom division, and hired 24 top students from\ntheir alma mater. And they've garnered rave reviews of their chip design\nfrom technology journals.\n\nOne thing that Cummings and Lines haven't done yet: finished their\ndegrees. Officially, both are now \"on leave.\" They may not be back.\n\n\n\n----\naDaM@XeNT.CoM\n\n\nHigh-tech startups fail for only three reasons: stupidity, luck, and greed. \n\nTip one for would-be entrepreneurs: Avoid stupid and unlucky people. If\nyou are stupid or have bad luck, don't start a high-tech business.\n\nTip two for would-be entrepreneurs: Do a product that you want to do,\nnot one that they want you to do.\n\nStartup founders generally have only ideas, charisma, and equity to work\nwith. Ideas and charisma are cheap, but equity is expensive.  To make a\nstart-up work, the founder has to divvy out parts of the business at\njust the right rate to keep everyone happy until the product is a\nsuccess. Give away too much of your company too soon to a venture\ncapitalist, to your co-workers, or even to yourself, and you risk\nrunning out of distributable shares before the product is done. And that\nprobably means the product won't be done. Ever.\n\nTip three for would-be entrepreneurs: Don't take venture funding too soon. \n\nIf you are doing a software product, don't take venture money until you\nneed it to introduce the product.  Don't take venture money until you\nhave used up all of your own money, your mother-in-law's money, and\neverything you can borrow.\n\nBootstrap. Rent, don't buy. Don't hire people to do things you can\ncontract out because contractors don't require stock options.\n\nAs the founder, the man or woman with the grand plan, your function is\nto manage the distribution of your own holdings so that you end up with\nfewer shares but more wealth.\n\nTip four for would-be entrepreneurs: Invite me to lunch. I'm a cheap date.\n\n  -- Robert X. Cringely, http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010614.html\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
