I'll win a little more read speed, and a lot more reliability.\n\n However, the RAID_HOWTO just mentions RAID 1 and RAID 0 on a machine\nthat's new. They don't mention anything about an existing setup. Is it\npossible to setup disk mirroring on a running box ?\n\nKate\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
