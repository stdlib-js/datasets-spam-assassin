Visa International, et al. in 1999,\nalleging it was harmed by Paul Guthrie, then\na vice president with Visa. ZixIt alleged in\nits suit that Guthrie posted more than 400\nanonymous messages, many of them negative,\nabout ZixIt on the Yahoo Finance ZixIt Internet\nmessage board, causing ZixIt's stock price to\ndrop.\n\nThe suit also alleged that the postings\ndestroyed the company's ability to market\nits ZixCharge Internet transaction\nauthorization system, which allows consumers\nto make purchases without revealing their\ncredit card numbers to merchants. Visa has\na similar Internet payment system.\n\nZixIt alleged that the postings caused its\nstock price to plummet. Had the product\nbeen successful, the company believed it\nwould have been worth more than $1 billion,\naccording to lawyers involved in the case.\n\nOn July 31, a jury in Judge Merrill Hartman's\n192nd District Court found that ZixIt's\nproduct was not harmed by the postings.\n\nNeal Manne and Kenneth McNeil, lawyers from\nHouston's Susman Godfrey who represented\nZixIt at trial, did not return calls for\ncomment by press time.\n\n\"The company hasn't made any decision about\nan appeal,\" says Cindy Lawrence, a ZixIt\nspokeswoman. \"The outcome of the lawsuit\ndoesn't have any effect on our future\nproducts and services in e-messaging.\"\n\nGETTING GRADED\n\nVisa's lawyers alleged that Guthrie acted on\nhis own and had a right to free speech, and\nthat Guthrie's Internet postings had no\neffect on ZixIt's stock. Guthrie has since\nleft Visa, lawyers for the company say.\nGuthrie was not a defendant in the case.\nHowever, his interests in the case were\nrepresented by Todd Noonan, an attorney in\nSacramento, Calif.'s Stevens & O'Connell.\nNoonan was recovering from surgery last\nweek and was unavailable for comment.\n\n\"I think people believe whether you\nsucceed or fail [is] because of what you\ndo and not what other people do to you.\nInternet companies didn't succeed for all\nsorts of reasons,\" says Jeff Tillotson, a\npartner in Dallas' Lynn, Tillotson & Pinker,\nwho defended Visa at trial.\n\nZixIt's case was a hard sell to the jury,\nespecially with the reality of the economy,\nTillotson says.\n\n\"Everyone knows that the stock market\nhas fallen and the trouble with Internet\ncompanies. I think the jury took that into\naccount,\" Tillotson says.\n\nThere were lessons to be learned from the\nInternet defamation trial, says Mike Lynn,\nwho also represented Visa at trial. Even\nthough message boards are considered a\nprotected form of free speech, that freedom\nwon't prevent a company from being dragged\ninto court if its employee blasts another\ncompany on the Internet, Lynn says.\n\n\"A company can be responsible for what an\nemployee posts on a message board,\" Lynn\nsays. \"The courts have said you're entitled\nto go to a jury to determine whether there\nare damages as a result of that. The law is\nvery odd, not mature, [and] damage theories\nare not mature.\"\n\nThe nature of the case also added an\ninteresting twist to the trial, Tillotson\nsays. Many of those who posted messages on\nthe board attended the trial and posted\ncomments about the daily proceedings\nthroughout the three-week trial, he says.\n\n\"It was apparent to everyone that many of\nthe people who posted on these message boards\nwere watching the trial,\" Tillotson says.\n\"It really was wild. The lawyers felt like\nthey were being graded.\"\n\n-- \n\n--- end forwarded text\n\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR. A.
