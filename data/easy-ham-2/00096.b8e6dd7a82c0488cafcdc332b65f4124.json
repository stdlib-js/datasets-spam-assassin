This was discussed on bugtraq a while\nago....lemme see...\nhttp://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/archive/bugtraq/2002/03/msg00372.html shows a\nmessage from nmap's author on the subject.  The only thing having IPID==0\nachieves is that you have one more criteria on which to base your OS\nfingerprint which isn't really much of a problem to be honest.\n\nStop worrying about it :)\n\nCheers,\njr\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: \"Paul O'Neil\" <poneil@dbiassociates.net>\nTo: <ilug@linux.ie>\nSent: Monday, July 22, 2002 1:50 PM\nSubject: [ILUG] nmap results\n\n\n> I had posted previously about the 2.4 kernel using iptables I ran nmap\n> against.
