Ever since social thinkers\nbegan trying to predict the pace of population growth a century or two ago,\nthe people being counted have been surprising the experts and confounding\nprojections. Today, it is happening again as stunned demographers watch\nbirthrates plunge in ways they never expected.\n\nOnly a few years ago, some experts argued that economic development and\neducation for women were necessary precursors for declines in population\ngrowth. Today, village women and slum families in some of the poorest\ncountries are beginning to prove them wrong, as fertility rates drop faster\nthan predicted toward the replacement level - 2.1 children for the average\nmother, one baby to replace each parent, plus a fraction to compensate for\nunexpected deaths in the overall population.\n\nA few decades ago in certain countries like Brazil, Egypt, India and Mexico\nfertility rates were as high as five or six.\n\nAs a result, United Nations demographers who once predicted the earth's\npopulation would peak at 12 billion over the next century or two are\nscaling back their estimates. Instead, they cautiously predict, the world's\npopulation will peak at 10 billion before 2200, when it may begin declining.\n\nSome experts are wary of too much optimism, however. At the Population\nCouncil, an independent research organization in New York, Dr. John\nBongaarts has studied population declines in various countries over the\nlast half century. He questions the assumption that when fertility declines\nbegin they will continue to go down at the same pace, especially if good\nfamily planning services are not widely available.\n\nSharp fertility declines in many industrialized and middle-income countries\nhad already challenged another old belief: that culture and religion would\nthwart efforts to cut fertility. In Italy, a Roman Catholic country whose\nbig families were the stuff of cinema, family size is shrinking faster than\nanywhere else in Europe, and the population is aging rapidly as fewer\nchildren are born. Islamic Iran has also had great success with family\nplanning.\n\n\"Projections aren't terribly accurate over the long haul,\" said Dr.\nNicholas Eberstadt, a demography expert at the American Enterprise\nInstitute in Washington. \"Demographers have been surprised by just about\nevery big fertility change in the modern period. Demographers didn't\nanticipate the baby boom. They did not anticipate the subsequent decline in\nfertility in industrialized Western democracies.\"\n\nWhat's next? Demographers can agree generally on a few measurable facts and\nsome trends. The world's population, now 6.2 billion, quadrupled in the\n20th century, and changed in drastic ways. In 1900, 86 percent of the\nworld's people lived in rural areas and about 14 percent in urban areas. By\n2000, urban communities were home to 47 percent of the population, with 53\npercent still in the countryside.\n\nBetween now and 2030, when the global population is expected to reach about\neight billion, almost all the growth will be in cities. But urbanization is\nnot necessarily a bad thing for the environment, said Dr. Joseph Chamie,\ndirector of the United Nations' population division.\n\n\"Moving to cities frees up the land for forestry, agriculture and many\nother activities,\" Dr. Chamie said. \"You're getting people concentrated, so\nyou can probably recycle more easily. People change their lifestyles. The\nIndian moving from the boonies of Uttar Pradesh to the city of Lucknow gets\neducational opportunities, cultural opportunities, all sorts of political\nparticipation. He can be influenced by advertising and public relations\ncampaigns. Immunization will be better, and family planning.\"\n\nAs births fall and lives are extended, the global population is getting\nolder. The over-80 age group is the fastest growing.\n\nBut not everywhere. For example, the United Nations calculates that life\nexpectancy at birth is being slashed in countries hardest hit by AIDS. In\nSouth Africa, the life of a baby born now should be 66 years; AIDS has cut\nthat to 47. In Zimbabwe, the drop has been to 43 years from 69. In\nBotswana, it is 36 years, down from 70.\n\nAnother cautionary sign from projections is that where populations are\ncontinuing to grow fastest, societies and governments may be least likely\nto cope with the results, including strains on natural resources -\nfarmland, water, air, forests and animals.\n\nLast year, the organization published a report and wall chart, \"Population,\nEnvironment and Development,\" plotting and analyzing population changes as\nits contribution to the debate surrounding the Johannesburg summit meeting.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that the world's current population, 6.2\nbillion, is growing at an annual rate slightly over 1.2 percent, producing\nsome 77 million people. Of this growth, 97 percent is taking place in\nless-developed countries, said Dr. Chamie, whose position at the United\nNations makes him chief keeper of the world's statistics. Six nations will\ndominate this growth, and in this order: India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria,\nBangladesh and Indonesia.\n\nThus, though fertility is declining unexpectedly in a poor country like\nIndia, which has more than a billion people, the actual numbers continue to\nrise rapidly because the base is so large. India is gaining as many people\nannually as China, Pakistan and Nigeria combined, the United Nations says.\n\nIndia is projected to have at least 100 million more people than China by\n2050, even if China's one-child policy is relaxed. Small families are now\nthe norm for the Chinese, whose standard of living has risen above that of\nthe people of India by many measures.\n\nAmong industrialized countries, the United States alone has a growth rate\ncomparable to that of developing nations. It now ranks seventh in growth,\nDr. Chamie said, but 80 percent of that growth comes from immigration. In\nEurope, populations are shrinking, even with more immigration.\n\nWith much of the population bulge predicted in Asia, the East-West Center\nin Honolulu has just published a report, \"The Future of Population in\nAsia,\" which finds cause to fear considerable environmental stress in a\nregion where population densities and numbers are often great. Asia, the\nreport notes, already has 56 percent of the world's population living on 31\npercent of its arable land, and more than 900 million people exist on less\nthan $1 a day.\n\n\"Asia faces the most acute pressure on arable agricultural land of any\nregion in the world,\" the report says, adding that expansion of farmland\nhas been made at the cost of forests. Acute water scarcity, a significant\nloss of biodiversity and more urban pollution seem inevitable. Twelve of\nthe world's 15 most polluted cities are in Asia. By 2020, the report\npredicts, Asia will be producing more carbon dioxide emissions than any\nother region.\n\n\"When looking at current and future environmental concerns in Asia,\" the\nreport concludes, \"the number of people to be fed, clothed, housed,\ntransported, educated and employed may not be the only issue, but it is an\nissue that cannot be ignored.\"\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
