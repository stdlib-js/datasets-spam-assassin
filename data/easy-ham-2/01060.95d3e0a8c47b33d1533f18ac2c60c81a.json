FREDRIKSEN\n\nThe expatriate in films is nothing new. Casablanca starring Humphrey \nBogart as the suave, mysterious Rick in Morocco remains the top favorite \n60 years after its release in America. Although expat characters' lives \nare traditionally painted as being extraordinary, the simple fact that \nthey live \"elsewhere\" adds a sense of adventure, a dash of romance, and \na bit of wishful longing. However, expats have never made the kind of \nimpact on films that non-resident Indians (NRIs) have with Hindi cinema, \nboth at the box office and on the big screen.\n\nAccording to India's 2001 census, the country's population exceeded the \n1 billion persons milestone, and there are approximately 11 million \nIndians living, working, and studying elsewhere around the world. NRIs \nhave become a serious market for the Hindi film industry, particularly \nin the U.K., where approximately 3 percent of the population is \nIndian/Pakistani, and in the U.S., where 1.7 million out of 281.5 \nmillion people are Indian. The rupee box office is now augmented quite \nhandsomely by the dollar-and-pound box office, much to the delight of \ndirectors and producers.\n\nAmong the films reporting a half-to-three-quarters-of-a-million-dollar \nbox office in the U.S. or the U.K. are Aa Ab Laut Chalen (1999), Kaho \nNaa Pyaar Hai (2000), Refugee (2000), Lajja (2001), and Asoka (2001). \nThe NRI \"million-dollar-box-office club\" boasts such films as Yaadein \n(2001) and Lagaan (2001) in the U.S. Taal (1999), Hum Saath Saath Hain \n(HSSH, 1999), and Mohabbatein (2000) made the mark or better in the U.K. \nTaal and HSSH doubled their U.K. intakes in the U.S. and brought in $2 \nmillion each. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) tallied up $2.6 million in the \nU.K. Most recently, setting a new high-water mark in the overseas box \noffice, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (K3G, 2001) grabbed the No. 10 spot its \nfirst week of release in the U.S. and earned $2.9 million during its \nfive-week run. In the U.K., K3G earned nearly $3.6 million over an 18 \nweek run.\n\nImpressive? Yes, considering that promotion of Hindi films outside of \nthe Indian community is virtually zero, although that may be on the \nbrink of changing slightly. If nothing else, the figures indicate that \nthe NRI spends a big chunk of change on the films.\n\nDuring the past decade, the inclusion of NRI characters in both \ncommercial and non-commercial films has been on the rise, and in a \ncircular logic, it's only natural that they have become a part of these \nfilms' stories. Each NRI touches someone in India, and these \"global \nIndians,\" as filmmaker Subhash Ghai has called them, cannot be shrugged \noff as a passing phase. Films featuring or \"made for\" NRIs have been \ncriticized by some in India, but in reality, many of those films have \nperformed extremely well at the Indian box office. Could this speak to \nthe lure of adventure and the romance of the NRI?\n\nThe first Hindi blockbuster to spotlight NRI characters was Dilwale \nDulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ, 1995), the story of two young people who grew \nup Indian in London. DDLJ introduced us to the mischievous, \nprank-pulling Raj, who in the beginning fails to graduate but succeeds \nin pilfering a case of beer from an Indian-owned convenience store. In \nthe end, he steadfastly applies Indian sensibilities in his pursuit of \nthe rebellious-but-trapped Simran as her unwanted arranged marriage \napproaches. Very possibly, because of this juxtaposition of traits, \nattitudes, and events, DDLJ enjoys the distinction of being the \nlongest-continually-running film in Indian cinema history.\n\nPopularity aside, there is the ongoing issue regarding accuracy in the \ncharacterization of NRIs in films. Often they are drawn as stereotypes, \nwhich are easy to lean on, requiring neither depth nor dimension. \nBecause of this, Hindi filmmakers may be said to straddle the border \nseparating East and West, staying securely at home and dipping into \ntheir highly-fantasized world of the Indian diaspora.\n\nIn many cases, commercial Hindi films present an overly-devised sense of \nthe NRI as being either corruptly-Westernized or as being more homesick \nthan a child gone away to camp for the first time. While these concepts \nmay carry a certain truth, the corresponding misconceptions come from \nthe minds of the at-home Indians, who wag a seemingly-envious finger at \nthe NRI's ability to exist in two worlds: one allowing space and upward \nmobility, the other offering traditions and history.\n\nPompous, materialistic, alcohol-drinking, cigarette-smoking, \ndrug-taking, affair-having, spoiled brats �\n\nThe first Hindi film I saw was Subhash Ghai's Pardes (1997). Despite \nencouraging me to see more films, it made me wonder if \"NRI\" actually \nmeant \"Not Really Indian.\" If the NRI characters weren't silly, whiney \ntroublemakers, they were mean and nasty, embracing every possible \nnegative human quality in stark contrast to the pristine Kusum Ganga. \nEven the dialogue and song lyrics in the film were designed to instruct \nthe viewer that the West is inferior but one can still bring India back \ninto one's life. The film is propaganda at its finest and filled with \nrelentless reminders of good vs. evil, purity vs. corruption, right vs. \nwrong, traditional vs. modern � in short India vs. the West.\n\nBut this is not where the negativity ends.\n\nVery often, there is a \"dress code\" for the female characters to help \nthe viewer understand her measure of purity or wickedness: the more \ntraditionally-dressed, the more Indian the woman. Unsurprisingly, this \ndoes not seem to carry over to the men's characters.\n\nRunning alongside this can be the \"training guide\" in which NRIs are \nconstantly reeducated that \"This is not India �,\" \"This is not America \n�,\" \"Only in India �,\" \"This is our culture.\" The repetition seems less \ndesigned to be a natural part of life than to foster reinforcement, as \nif NRIs are too ignorant to appreciate it the first time.\n\nWhen Indians achieve success and wealth, have large homes, and own their \ncompanies in these films, they are industrious, clever, and respected \nbusinessmen. The NRI equivalent is held up to a double standard and \nconsidered materialistic. Even the printed synopsis of Taal in the Eros \nEntertainment/B4U DVD booklet refers to the NRI characters' \"world of \nruthless materialism.\" On the other hand, the Mumbai-based, plagiarizing \nVikrant Kapoor character is likeable enough and presented as an \nopportunist, which seems to be a step up.\n\nItaly is an unlikely origin for an NRI and offspring in a Hindi film, \nbut Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (2000) filled the bill. For all the film's \nsplendor, it was regrettable that the Indo-Italian Sameer was presented \nas a na�ve, bumbling nerd who had little going for him beyond his \nsinging ability.\n\nYaadein gave us a kind and loving, if slightly confused, single parent \nfrom London raising three daughters who suffer enough issues to put a \ntherapist into a tailspin. As if that weren't enough, the film includes \nan American-raised brat who wants nothing to do with parents, settling \ndown, or having babies�hardly the ideal Indian bride-to-be.\n\nAnd what happens when a married NRI couple splits into the \"modern\" vs. \nthe \"old-fashioned?\" The wife is tossed out like the garbage and sent \nhome to India as punishment for being unreceptive to having affairs \noutside of marriage. Such is the initial setup for Lajja, Rajkumar \nSantoshi's look into the world of Indian women.\n\nShow me the way to go home �\n\nThe other extreme of NRIs in film is the homesick, culture-craving, \nmore-patriotic-than-thou Indian. Building their own mini-Indias for \nmaxi-memories, this NRI portrayal takes a real issue and magnifies it to \nunreal proportions. And no film illustrates that as extravagantly as the \nlush and sumptuous Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham (K3G).\n\nNot only did K3G enjoy a healthy run at home, it exploded worldwide onto \ntheater screens in Indian communities last December and played to packed \nhouses for weeks. And K3G is a film in which everything�homes, \ntransportation, finances, fashion, holidays, events, emotions, and \ntears�sets a new standard for the term \"larger-than-life.\"\n\nIn K3G, much of the post-interval footage takes place in England. For \nAnjali, life in London simmers with a patriotic zeal and an \nall-consuming homesickness manifested in the meticulous maintenance of \nIndian customs and rituals while she separates herself from her \nsurroundings. Her need for India is so overwhelming that she relies on \nthe false protection of mocking people and places outside of her own \nfamily and home.\n\nOverkill? Certainly, as writer-director Karan Johar's inflated \nrepresentation of what have become some of the filmi passions of the \ntypical NRI. But when it boils down to the common denominators without \nthe fanfare, flash, and fervor, even those who move across country miss \ntheir families and familiar surroundings; one always retains a credible \namount of home-turf loyalty; and if one's heritage is lost, the person \nis rendered as no more than a racial statistic.\n\n\"Those living in India are surrounded by our culture every minute, even \nif they don't realize it,\" says Vivek Malhotra, a thirty-something NRI \nand business owner in the Chicago area. \"Here it's different, but we \nwill always be Indian,\" he continues, striking at the heart of the \nperceived problem. \"Sometimes, I feel that the movies think we've \nforgotten that. Maybe the filmmakers should spend some time finding out \nwho we are. I really don't think they have a clue.\"\n\nOn the upside is a beneficial aspect for the children of NRIs. \"It's \ngood that these films show our kids what happens in India�the \ntraditions, customs, values,\" says Parag Gandhi, a long time theater \nowner and promoter of Hindi films in Chicago. \"They may be modernized in \nIndia, but the traditional values remain.\" And many popular films target \nthe late-teens, twenty-something demographic. \"Films such as Dilwale \nDulhania Le Jayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, and K3G,\" adds Gandhi, \"are \nexamples of films that are half traditional, half modern, striking a \nbalance between the two for all of the markets.\"\n\nAnother positive consideration is that not all films show NRIs in a \nquestionable light. Caricatures of NRIs have been challenged in \ncommercial films like Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, Dil Chhata Hai (2001), Monsoon \nWedding (2001), and the recent Kitne Door Kitne Paas, all of which \npresent NRIs as more realistic, more human characters. Aa Ab Laut Chalen \noffers a variety of NRI personalities from the selfish, the conniving, \nand the party animal to the lovable cabbies and the pandit-cop who make \nthe best of their situations without complaint. Interestingly, the film \nalso dares to include shop owners, Dunkin' Donuts clerks, gas station \nattendants: characters who aren't weighed down by palatial surroundings, \ncorporate crises, or overseas judgments.\n\nThe U.S., the U.K., and Australia are represented in Bombay Boys (1999) \nby three young men coming/returning to Bombay, India for personal \nreasons. In a refreshing reversal of the typical attitude concerning \nNRIs in film, the boys are the \"good\" Indians, and everyone they meet \nhas some relationship with the darker side of the city. At its most \nbasic, the film shows that if something is lost, it won't necessarily be \nfound in India.\n\nEven the non-commercial, multi-award-winning Bawandar (2001) \nincorporates an NRI as a connecting thread in the piecing together of \nSanvri Devi's story. Curious, passionate about women's rights, the \nIndo-English journalist represents the fact that the story has a wider \ninterest than a small, rural village.\n\nStepping outside of the Hindi film industry for a moment, the \nEnglish/Telegu film Hyderabad Blues (1998) and the English/Tamil film \nMitr�My Friend (2002), both smaller-budget films built on delivering \nmessages without preaching, deserve mention. The former engages in the \nquestioning of, rather than the criticism of, East vs. West, and the \nlatter examines the challenges faced by women, NRIs, and their families. \nThe characters and stories of both films enjoy respect in their \npresentation, partially due to the existence of layered issues that are \nrevealed and resolved (or not) without finger-snapping swiftness or \nclich�d answers. Hyderabad Blues enjoyed a 31-week run in Mumbai alone, \nand Mitr�My Friend is currently one of the most-rented films in Indian \ncommunities in the U.S.\n\nWhile the inclusion of NRIs in Hindi films does not guarantee box office \nsuccess outside of India, it does send a strong signal that filmmakers \nacknowledge this constantly growing and lucrative audience sector. If \nthe big-budget, big box-office commercial films coming out of Mumbai \noften seem to bite one of the hands that feeds it, has the box office \nanywhere been adversely affected? Well � no, not by any charted reports \nthat can be found. And that, itself, sends a loud and clear message back \nto the industry in Mumbai: \"if it isn't broken, don't fix it.\"\n\nNevertheless, when filmmakers who see NRIs as falling only to the evil \nside of Western ways look beyond their assumptions, perhaps they will \ndiscard their reliance on stereotypes and start paying their overseas \nfamily an increased measure of respect. And when filmmakers who take the \nhomesick and patriotic themes beyond believability analyze their own \nfeelings, perhaps they will realize that what NRIs hold dear in their \nhearts is no different from what those at home should be proud of. n\n\nNOTE: All box office figures are reported as US$ and are courtesy of \nVariety Magazine online archives. Not all Hindi films abroad report box \noffice, and not all box office reports are available.\n\nJeanne E. Fredriksen writes from Chicago. She is family with, friends \nwith, acquainted with, and works for NRIs with an amazing variety of \npersonalities, attitudes, hopes, dreams, goals, livelihoods, needs, \nwants, and beliefs.\n\n=========================================\n�\nDilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge\n\nSo globally successful is the film that in 1999 it warranted a billboard \noutside Shinjuku train station in Tokyo, Japan, announcing its \nscreenings sponsored by India Center there. Shinjuku is the \nentertainment center of Tokyo, and there is plenty of high-profile \ncompetition for attention, attendance, and box office. In Japan, where \nIndian films enjoy a certain popularity with the natives, the country's \n1995 population census of 125.6 million persons showed only 4,244 were \nIndian with an additional 13,589 being other South Asians. Without \nquestion, DDLJ continues to be a favorite whenever, wherever offered for \nviewing.\n\nKabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham\n\nAccording to a report in the South China Morning Post in January, 2002, \nall screenings of K3G in December, 2001, were sell-outs in Hong Kong, \nwhile pirated copies of the film were the hottest items circulating on \nthe island. Hong Kong's 2001 population census of 6.3 million people \nrevealed that 18,543 were Indian and another 23,581 were Nepalese and \nPakistani. K3G's popularity in the Special Administrative Region was \nimpressive because Hong Kong enjoys being the third-largest producer of \nfilms by volume after India and the U.S. �\t\n\n\n=====================================================\nBhansali's Musical Heaven\n\nBy ANIRUDDH CHAWDA\n\nDEVDAS (Universal, 2002). Hindi film soundtrack. Music: Ismail Darbar. \nLyrics: Nusrat Badr\n\nFor perhaps the most eagerly anticipated film of the year, filmmaker \nSanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas had to deliver a score that not only met \nthe hype but also let Ismail Darbar prove that the mega-selling Hum Dil \nDe Chuke Sanam was no one-time flash in the pan. By devising a \nsemi-classical, once-in-a-decade, 100 percent \"Indian\" musical score, \nBhansali and Darbar emerge victorious in baking and serving a 10-layer \nmonumental soundtrack.\n\nWhat is most groundbreaking is the powerful one-two punch of lyrics by \nnewcomer Nusrat Badr and the from-soul-voice of first-timer Shreya \nGhosal. Ghosal's voice, reminiscent of both Suman Kalyanpur with a \nslightly thicker pitch and Anuradha Paudwal without the nasal monotone, \nis the most original singing voice since Kavita Subramaniam appeared in \nthe Mangeshkar mold. Ghosal's \"Silsila ye chaahat ka\" is a sultry \ntabla-dominated opening to 52 minutes of sheer musical bliss. \"Maar \ndaala\" (Subramaniam, KK) is an excellent example of the use of classical \nragas to complement, rather than fill-in, interludes between verses. On \n\"Kahe chhed,\" Pandit Birju Maharaj, using his own tune, adds an \nintoxicating opening for Madhuri Dixit's vocals and Subramaniam to \nfinish out a piercing song of longing.\n\nWhile a combination of Ghosal and Subramaniam give life to on-screen \nlip-synching for Madhuri Dixit and Aishwarya Rai, on the male side Udit \nNarayan fronts for Shah Rukh Khan. Narayan's on-target \"Bairi piya,\" a \nduet with Ghosal, could find company in many Lata-Rafi duets of yore. \nThe up-tempo \"Chalak chalak\" again smoothly floats Narayan with Vinod \nRathod and Ghosal while Subramaniam and Ghosal's jugalbandhi on \"Dola re \ndola\" simply shakes the rafters.\n\nPackaged in Universal's Bombay plant, the earliest CD pressings have a \ncheap, paper-thin casing. Purists may consider replacing the cheap cover \nwith a store-bought sturdier one. At a suggested Bombay retail value of \nabout $2 and selling like hot cakes stateside for $10 a pop, Devdas is \nwithout doubt a huge profit-maker for the multinational music marketer. \nBut buyers beware: avoid being distracted by bootleg CDs. This \nexceptional music and exceptionally well-recorded CD deserve \nunadulterated musical glory. Pop in only a properly copyrighted, \noriginal CD and let Darbar & Co. whisk you away on a magical musical \nride.\n\nLifelong cinephile Aniruddh Chawda lives, works, and writes from \nWisconsin, on America's north coast.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
