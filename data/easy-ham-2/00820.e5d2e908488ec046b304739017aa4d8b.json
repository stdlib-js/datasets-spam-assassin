They come across a lantern and a\ngenie pops out of it.  \"I will give you each one wish, \" says the genie.\nThe American says, \"I am a farmer, my dad was a farmer, and my son will\nalso farm. I want the land to be forever fertile in America.\" With a blink\nof the genie's eye, 'FOOM'  -  the land in America was forever made\nfertile for farming.  The Frenchman was amazed, so he said, \"I want a wall\naround France, so that no one can come into our precious country.\"  Again,\nwith a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF'  -  there was a huge wall around\nFrance.  The Englishman asks, \"I'm very curious. Please tell me more about\nthis wall.  The Genie explains, \"Well, it's about 150 feet high, 50 feet\nthick and nothing can get in or out.\"  The Englishman says, \"Fill it up\nwith water.\"\n\nFenchie>Plutt nous devrions nous noyer que mangent la cuisine anglaise.\n\nShlpey> Them French, you dont know what they are on about but damn it sure\nsounds romantic. And you knwo they are great lovers those french are. A\npsychology professor decided to study the way in which different people\nfrom different parts of Europe have sex with sheep. He traveled first to\nWales, where he asks a farmer to explain his method: \"Well, boyo, I put\nher back legs down my nice green wellies, grab her with me velcro gloves,\nand we're well away. Tidy!\"  The professor tries Scotland next \"Hoots an'\ntoots man, I put her back legs down my nice green wellies, grab her with\nme velcro gloves, and we're  well away. Och aye tha noo!\"  The professor\nmoves on to Germany: \"Well, I find the most efficient way is to grab her\nwith my velcro gloves, and we're well away. The professor is noticing a\npattern developing, so he decides to try France, and then end his\ninvestigation.  He stops a bloke by the Eiffel tower named Pierre, and\nasks him to explain the French method: \"Well monsieur, I put her back legs\ndown my nice green wellies, sling her front legs over me shoulders, and\nthat's all there is to it!\" The professor is excited to have found some\nnational variation and tells Pierre that this is different to the methods\nof the Scots, Welsh and Germans. \"How do they do it then?\" asks Pierre,\nand the professor explains. Pierre on hearing the explanation walks of\ndisgusted. \"What! No kissing?\"\n\nFrenchie>Voil.
