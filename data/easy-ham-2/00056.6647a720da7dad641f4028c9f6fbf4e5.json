If my distributor is unable to book the film into a\n> theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to\n> quickly set up a screening for its members.\n>\n> I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I\n> originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of\n> REVOLUTION OS.  There are several reasons why I made the request, and\n> none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk.\n>\n> One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open\n> Source movement would not be available for open viewings.  Another\n> SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter\n> to Hobbyists.\n>\n> The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement,\n> but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open\n> Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch.  If I made a movie about\n> the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a\n> vegetarian.\n>\n> I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects\n> worth exploring and documenting.  As a result, I came to admire many\n> aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary\n> on the movement's positive history.

More practically, my\n> feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you\n> see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits.\n>\n> I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing\n> is considered fair use.  I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine.\n> However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at\n> home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a\n> university campus.  So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized\n> screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter.  Personally, I\n> believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should\n> retain the choice to Open Source their IP.  If the Open Source movement\n> is not voluntary then it is really just piracy.\n>\n> One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of\n> the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin\n> selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a\n> license permitting noncommercial large group screenings.  We hope to use\n> the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the\n> DVD.  I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford\n> to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt.  Thus the importance of\n> preserving the educational/institutional market.\n>\n> Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists\n> that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the\n> artists and only hurts the greedy record labels.  Well, in the case of\n> REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish.\n> It's just me.  I made and financed the film on my own.  I have worked\n> full-time for almost three years without a salary.  The only way I will\n> get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek\n> out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS.\n>\n> I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for\n> REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.  If you\n> will just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested\n> persons to legally view it.\n>\n> I hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening\n> at UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone.\n>\n> Sincerely,\n>\n> J.T.S.
