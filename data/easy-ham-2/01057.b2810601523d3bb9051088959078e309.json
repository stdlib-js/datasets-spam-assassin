No, no one has a problem quarantining\nsomeone who has say, Ebola, or malaria, because diseases do not\nrequire any decisive action -- just contact.\n\nfantasies, still require decisive action, even if its in conjunction\nwith the way the fantasy works in the individual's brain. Many people\nhave very strange and obscure fantasies (say wanting to be a model)\nthat dont' require them to be locked up.\n\nFantasies aren't nearly as much like plagues.   Not everyone in a\ngiven population necessarily adheres to that given fantasy, whereas\neveryone can get a given plague.   (BTW, gary, the whole concept of\nmonitoring a given 'racial populaiton' for fear of them getting a\nplague is silly.  I don't think plagues discriminate)\n\nYou're trying to argue for a lock'em all up mentality, when I don't\nthink anyone but you has even mentioned it.   His point was that\nfantaesies were a psychological? explanation for a possible event.\nNot that all people who have them, or even have a certain type, need\nto be locked up, quarantined, killed, rubbed-out or cleansed.\n\n\n\nGLM> Well, for example ..\n\n>>>>>> \"b\" == bitbitch  <bitbitch@magnesium.net> writes:\n\nGLM>     b> Once we understand this [ the fantasy virus model ], many of\nGLM>     b> our current perplexities will find themselves\nGLM>     b> resolved.
