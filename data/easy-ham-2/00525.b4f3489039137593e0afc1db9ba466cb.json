Turns of Phrase: Beanpole family\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nHistorically, families have usually had more children than parents,\nresulting in family trees that looked like pyramids. However, in\nrecent years, especially in countries like Britain and the US, the\nnumber of children per generation has steadily gone down, while\nlife span has increased. This has led to a shape of family tree\nthat some researchers have likened to a beanpole - tall and thin,\nwith few people in each generation. The term \"beanpole family\" has\nbeen around in the academic literature at least since 1987, but it\nrarely appears elsewhere. A recent British report has brought it to\nwider public notice, at least in the UK. Some researchers find it\ntoo slangy and prefer the jargon term \"verticalised\" to describe\nsuch families. Whatever term you prefer, specialists are sure that\nthe demographic shift is having a big effect on personal\nrelationships within the family and (for example) the role of\ngrandparents.\n\nThe rising divorce rate partly explains the growth of the\n'beanpole' family. With almost one in two marriages ending in\ndivorce, many adults have at least two families, each with a single\nchild.\n                                             [\"Observer\", May 2002]\n\nNoting the rising number of so-called 'beanpole' families in\nBritain (families with only one child), the report warns that a\nchild without siblings 'is starved of the companionship of family\nmembers of their own age ... [leading to] greater social isolation,\nwith teenagers adopting a more selfish attitude to life'.\n                                            [\"Guardian\", June 2002]\n\n\n2. Weird Words: Jobbernowl\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nA stupid person, a blockhead.\n\nUnfortunately, this useful and effective insult has rather dropped\nout of use in these mealy-mouthed times. The last excursion for it\nthat I can find is in the classic W C Fields film \"The Bank Dick\"\nof 1940, in which the word occurs in a variant form in the line:\n\"Surely, don't be a luddie-duddie, don't be a moon-calf, don't be a\njabbernow, you're not those, are you?\". Before that, it turns up in\none of the novels of Hall Caine in 1890, but even by then it seems\nto have been rather rare.\n\nIt's from the old French \"jobard\", from \"jobe\", silly. That word\nwas then added to \"noll\", the top or crown of the head, the noddle.\nThe first sense was of a block-like or stupid-looking head, but was\nsoon extended to refer to the quality of the mind within.\n\"Jobbernowlism\" is the condition or state of being a \"jobbernowl\",\nor an act or remark that is especially stupid.\n\nCareful how you use it: the recipient might be a subscriber!\n\n\n3. Beyond Words\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nI've been away at a heritage conference in Colchester these past\nfew days. On my way back, my eye was caught by this warning sign\nposted above some steps at the local railway station:\n\n   Caution\n   Do not run on the stairs\n   Use the hand rail\n\n\n4. Q&A\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ. For my job I have to read American magazines concerning consumer\nelectronics, home systems, burglar alarms, etc. I very often come\nacross the expression \"bells and whistles\", which seem to relate to\nequipment, accessories or features that are offered to the customer\nas plusses but are not really indispensable for the device to work.\nIs that right? And where does that funny phrase come from? [Herve\nCastelain, France]\n\nQ. You're right about the meaning of this phrase, which refers to\ngimmicks - non-essential but often engaging features added to a\npiece of technical equipment or a computer program to make it seem\nmore superficially attractive without enhancing its main function.\n\nThe phrase is actually quite modern and may be a product of the\nAmerican military. At least, one of its earliest appearances was in\nan article in \"Atlantic\" in October 1982, which said it was\n\"Pentagon slang for extravagant frills\". There's some evidence that\nthe term has actually been around since the 1960s, but the early\nevidence is sparse.\n\nWhere it comes from is still a matter of learned debate. A literal\nsense of the phrase appeared around the middle of the nineteenth\ncentury, referring to streetcars, railways and steamships. Before\nmodern electronics, there were really only two ways to make a loud\nwarning noise - you either rang a bell or tooted a whistle. Steam\nmade the latter a real power in the land (anybody who has heard the\nnoisy out-of-tune calliope on the steamboat Natchez at New Orleans\nwill agree about its power, though less so about its glory). And at\none time \"clang, clang, clang went the trolley\" in large numbers of\nAmerican cities.\n\nAt least some early US railroad locomotives had both bells and\nwhistles, as this extract from an article in \"Appleton's Journal\"\nof 1876 shows:\n\n  You look up at an angle of sixty degrees and see sweeping\n  along the edge of a precipice, two-thirds up the rocky\n  height, a train of red-and-yellow railway-cars, drawn by\n  two wood-burning engines, the sound of whose bells and\n  whistles seems like the small diversions of very little\n  children, so diminished are they by the distance.\n\nCould it be that to have both bells and whistles was thought\nexcessive, a case of belt and braces, an unnecessary feature, a\nfrill?\n\nPossibly. But it's more probable the slang sense of the term comes\nfrom that close musical relative of the calliope, the theatre\norgan. Extraordinary instruments such as the Mighty Wurlitzer\naugmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to\nhelp the organist accompany silent films, among them car horns,\nsirens, and bird whistles. These effects were called toys, and\norgans often had \"toy counters\" with 20 or more noisemakers on\nthem, including various bells and whistles. In the 1950s, decades\nafter the talkies came in, but while theatre organs were still\ncommon in big movie houses, these fun features must have been\nconsidered no longer essential to the function of the organ but\nmere fripperies, inessential add-ons.\n\nIt's possible the slang sense grew out of that. It got taken up\nespecially by the computing industry, perhaps because opportunities\nto add them are so great.\n\n                        -----------\n\nQ. The designation of \"robes\" for academic dress clearly comes from\nits origin with the clergy in the Middle Ages. But what about\n\"mortarboards\"? The best I could find was its origin in the 12th or\n13th century clergy cap, but that was not square-shaped. Does\n\"mortarboard\" refer to the guilds or is its origin more ancient?\n\nA. The academic cap often called a \"mortarboard\" is quite ancient,\nbut that word for it only dates from the middle of the nineteenth\ncentury (a less slangy way to identify it is to call it a\n\"square\"). The literal mortar board is the wooden plate, usually\nwith a handle underneath, on which bricklayers carry small amounts\nof mortar. A similar tool is used by plasterers, but they usually\ncall it a hawk.\n\nWhat seems to have happened is that the similarity in shape between\nthe brickie's board and the academic cap led some wag, probably at\nOxford University, to apply the name of the one to the other. Our\nfirst recorded use is in a book of 1853-6, \"The Adventures of Mr.\nVerdant Green, an Oxford Freshman\" by a clergyman named Edward\nBradley, who wrote under the pen name of Cuthbert Bede (the names\nof the two patron saints of Durham, where he went to school).\nVerdant Green is a sort of undergraduate Pickwick and the book\nrecounts his adventures. This magisterial reprimand by a don\nappears after one such escapade: \"I will overlook your offence in\nassuming that portion of the academical attire, to which you gave\nthe offensive epithet of 'mortar-board'; more especially, as you\nacted at the suggestion and bidding of those who ought to have\nknown better\".\n\nAfter a slow start, the book became a huge success, selling more\nthan 200,000 copies in the next 20 years. Whether Mr Bradley\ninvented the slang term we may never know, but his book certainly\npopularised it.\n\n                        -----------\n\nQ. I got into a discussion about \"chip off the old block\" with\nfriends, and we are wondering if it had to do with sculpting,\njewelry making, woodworking, or none of the above. What does this\nterm mean, and where did it come from? [Vijay Renganathan]\n\nA. The associations are with carpentry, and the block is definitely\nmade of wood.\n\nThe first form of the expression was \"chip of the same block\",\nmeaning that a person or thing was made of the same stuff as\nsomebody or something else, so from the same source or parentage.\nAn early example is in a sermon by Dr Robert Sanderson (at one time\nBishop of Lincoln), dated 1637: \"Am not I a child of the same Adam\n... a chip of the same block, with him?\".\n\nLater that century, another form is recorded \"a chip of the old\nblock\", which meant that somebody was the spitting image of his\nfather, or continued some family characteristic. At some point,\nprobably late in the nineteenth century, this was modified to \"a\nchip off the old block\", which does nothing to change the sense,\nbut is the way it's now usually written or said.\n\n\n5.
