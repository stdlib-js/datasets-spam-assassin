I tried installing RedHat 7.3. It just didn't want\nto know about the graphics card. I's an onboard Intel DVMT chip. No\ndedicated memory, it takes it from the onboard RAM.\n\nI was wondering if anybody had gotton these machines and had any luck\ngetting this graphics card working?\n\nWhen this graphics card didn't work, I installed a PCI Diamond Stealth 64\nVRAM card. Xconfigurator auto-detected this and my 21\" SUN monitor no\nproblem but whenever it tries to test the configuration it fails and the\nscreen is left with a blue background and all of the text is blue.\nDoes anybody have any idea what the problem is or how to fix it?\nCheers,\ndeccy.\n\n-- \n---------------------------------------\nDeclan Houlihan\ndeccy@csn.ul.ie\nhttp://deccy.csn.ul.ie/\n---------------------------------------\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
