For one thing, it seems difficult to imagine you _not_ being aware\nthat XFree86 is under the X/MIT licence, that Perl is under the Perl\nArtistic Licence, that Apache is under the Apache licence, and that\nnumerous BSD utilities are under the BSD licence.\n\nFurthermore, xv, Acrobat Reader, pine, pico, Netscape Communicator, and\na whole slew of other applications typically included aren't under any\nopen source licence at all, but rather are proprietary.\n\n(2) You seem, in any event, to be under a misconception as to what the\nGPL provides, as to code under its umbrella.  It says (in part) that\n_if_ you have lawfully received a copy of covered binary code, then you\nmay insist on one of certain forms of access to the matching source\ncode.  Please note that it does _not_ guarantee you any rights\nwhatsoever if nobody's decided to give you a lawful copy.\n\n> But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It's not theirs to BSD!\n\nAgain, you seem to be under a misconception.  If you check, I'm quite\nconfident you'll see that SuSE are in full compliance with GPL v. 2's\nsource-code access provisions concerning GPLed code included in their\ndistribution.  And no, nobody has the legal right to alter licence terms\nto someone else's copyrighted property.  But you have not cited any\nreasons to believe that SuSE have done any of those things.\n \n> Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other than put up the ftp\n> version, but surely they can't prevent a CD owner from burning a copy\n> and giving it to me?\n\nSee below.  You and the CD owner would be committing copyright violation.\nSuSE Linux AG are rather unlikely to knock down your door and haul you\ndown to a judge, if that's what you're asking.\n\n> Nobody can oblige them to give away anything other than ftp - I'm not\n> asking for that. I'm asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to\n> burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange for a reasonable\n> consideration (say, the price of the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a\n> couple of pints?).\n\nYou appear confused between Linux the kernel (which is a copyrighted\nwork to which source code access is guaranteed under the GNU GPL if\nyou've received a lawful copy of a binary version) and the rather\nimprecise concept of a \"Linux distribution\", which is a number of works\nunder diverse licence terms collected onto some media.\n\nIn the case of SuSE's boxed sets -- which are NOT lawful to duplicate\nand redistribute in their entirety -- at least a couple of the\napplications on them (YaST, YaST2, and the installer program) are\nproprietary copyrighted works of SuSE Linux AG.  In the general case,\nduplicating and redistributing CD-ROMs containing those works is\ncopyright infringement.  Illegal.  No amount of hand-waving about the\nGNU GPL is going to change that.\n\n(SuSE permit people to duplicate and redistribute the \"evaluation\" and\n\"live-eval\" CD editions, despite that fact, as long as it is not \"for\nvalue\".)\n\nIf you want to have a SuSE boxed set to install from, buy one.\n\n> What does the GPL mean now?\n\nSuggestion:  Read it.  I would guess you've not yet done so.\n\n-- \nCheers,                                             Live Faust, die Jung.\nRick Moen\nrick@linuxmafia.com\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
