There doesn't seem to\nbe a lot of documentation around about it.\n\nDoes anybody know if it would be possible to do the following:\nGet the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart\nconfig file from teh DHCP server and in this config file\nhave the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when\nthe machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP.\n\nAlso, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy\nfor the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required\nme to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module\nfor the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going\nto be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was\nwondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot\ncdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card\nmodules on the cdrom. I'd still want it to get the packages from\nan NFS server on the network.\n\nAny help with this would be greatly appreciated,\ncheers,\ndeccy.\n\n-- \n---------------------------------------\nDeclan Houlihan\ndeccy@csn.ul.ie\nhttp://deccy.csn.ul.ie/\n---------------------------------------\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
