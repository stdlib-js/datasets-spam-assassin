[ ... ] The problem is the bulk of the data [ ... ]\n  |  > have two directory entries i.e. there is a hard link [ ... ]\n  | \n  | How about something like:\n  | \n  |    cd {dest.dir}\n  |    tar -C {source.dir} cf - | tar xf -\n  | \n  | tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it. This\n  | should keep permissions and links, and if you do it as root you will keep\n  | the owners too... :)\n  | \n  | Not tested, though. You may need other flags as well.\n\n the above (or something close to it) will work.\n\n however, the data will be read and written twice by the\n 1st (source) `tar', and read twice by the 2nd (sink) `tar',\n albeit only written once as the sink realizes the second\n copy is a hard link to the first.  with c.60Gb of data,\n that will make a difference, at least in time and CPU\n resource consumed (albeit, in this case, not storage).\n\n the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always\n contain the data for each name of a hard link.  this is\n (probably) for several reasons, and is not necessarily a\n bad thing.   e.g., it provides a degree of redundancy to\n help cope with bad media.\n\n the source `tar' is creating an archive, which is being\n written down the pipe (to be consumed by the sink `tar').\n that is why storage is not an issue per se here, as the\n full archive is not \"saved\" --- if it were, you'd need\n at least 2x60Gb, or over 120Gb!   (the extra is `tar's\n overhead, which is minimal but does add up, esp. when\n a \"large\" blocking factor is used.)\n\ncheers!\n\t-blf-\n--\n Innovative, very experienced, Unix and      | Brian Foster    Dublin, Ireland\n Chorus (embedded RTOS) kernel internals     | e-mail: blf@utvinternet.ie\n expert looking for a new position ...       | mobile: (+353 or 0)86 854 9268\n  For a résumé, contact me, or see my website  http://www.blf.utvinternet.ie\n\n    Stop E$$o (ExxonMobile):  «Whatever you do, don't buy Esso --- they\n     don't give a damn about global warming.»    http://www.stopesso.com\n     Supported by Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and numerous others...\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
