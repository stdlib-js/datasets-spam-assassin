(eg legal advice \"this\nis / is not legal advice\" type of thing. But again, this means \ndisclaimers need to context-specific. (see 1.)\n\n3. there is precedence that blanket disclaimers, under UK law, have \nno standing and that rather (common sense this) it is the context of \nthe situation that determines the legal effects of an email.\n\nSee the norwich union case. \n\nAnyway, my top tips to help superiors who've fallen for disclaimers \nto see sense:\n\n1. server side appends breaks email standards. (unless always done \ncorrectly - nearly impossible, cause then server has to understand \nevery possible type of client encoding).\n\n1a. it /does/ break certain types of encryption, that depend on the \nbody being untouched. (eg X.509? kate brought this up ages ago).\n\n1b. iirc, it contravenes MIME to pre/append non mime-typed text. Most \nmailers will work around this and display the mail 'correctly', some \nmight not though. Eg the message might not be displayed, or the \ndisclaimer might not be displayed.\n\n1c. the correct place for disclaimers is on the client side. this \nalso allows the user to select appropriate disclaimer for appropriate \ncontext (or no disclaimer at all).\n\n2. blanket appended disclaimers are of dubious legal effectiveness. \n(dilution, NU case in UK)\n\n3. generic disclaimer text is of dubious legal effectiveness. indeed\nit will often be completely inappropriate ('this message is\nconfidential' on list mail). see 1c. Also, it needs to be written by \nan actual lawyer.\n\n4. A lot of big multinational corporations do /not/ append \ndisclaimers. (ones i know of: Compaq (deceased), Motorol (iirc), \nMicrosoft (iirc)).\n\nUseful link:\n\nhttp://www.goldmark.org/jeff/stupid-disclaimers/\n(and see links at bottom of this page).\n\nfinally, if you cant get reason to prevail and you have to agree to\nimplementing server side disclaimers, you can still resort to:\n\n\t\"that'll be done just as soon as the company stationary has\n\tdisclaimers printed on them. oh, and i guess we'll have to play a\n\tdisclaimer before or after all our telephone calls too? \n\tWait, that would cause a problem for faxes wouldnt it?\"\n\n> kevin\n\nDisclaimer: IANAL, all the above might be wrong, i might even be \nintentionally misleading you. who knows.. go check it out for \nyourself.\n\nregards,\n-- \nPaul Jakma\tpaul@clubi.ie\tpaul@jakma.org\tKey ID: 64A2FF6A\n\twarning: do not ever send email to spam@dishone.st\nFortune:\nA real patriot is the fellow who gets a parking ticket and rejoices\nthat the system works.\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group Social Events: social@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/social for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
