If so wouldn't mind a bit \nof help.\n\n Burnt the ISO's from the latest Linux Format magazine. Took a couple of \nattempts to install but got there. My problem - I have a standard dial-up \nmodem and the installation gives you the network card setup so internet \ndownload is out of the question, but, I installed the Stage3 tarball which \nputs the .tgz files on your harddrive. \n\n So methinks, I have the software there and all I need to do is install so as \n1) get the necessary programmes to connect to the net and 2) install any \nother programmes I might need.\n\n What actually happens is that if, for example, I attempt to install the KDE \npackage, the system goes looking for any dependencies on the net despite the \nfact that the dependencies reside on my hard drive. Obviously I can't install \nanything.\n\n Have checked all docs on the web page and nothing deals with a standard \ndial-up modem or how to tell the package manager to look for the dependencies \non the hard drive.\n\n Anybody able to help me here?\n\n Thanks in anticipation.\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
