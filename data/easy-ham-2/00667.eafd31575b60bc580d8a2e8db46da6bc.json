The ears of\nsweet corn are just starting to show up on local farm stands,\ninaugurating one of the ceremonies of an American summer. These days the\nnation's nearly 80 million-acre field of corn rolls across the\ncountryside like a second great lawn, but this wholesome, all-American\nimage obscures a decidedly more dubious reality.\n\nLike the tulip, the apple and the potato, zea mays (the botanical name\nfor both sweet and feed corn) has evolved with humans over the past\n10,000 years or so in the great dance of species we call domestication.\nThe plant gratifies human needs, in exchange for which humans expand the\nplant's habitat, moving its genes all over the world and remaking the\nland (clearing trees, plowing the ground, protecting it from its\nenemies) so it might thrive.\n\nCorn, by making itself tasty and nutritious, got itself noticed by\nChristopher Columbus, who helped expand its range from the New World to\nEurope and beyond. Today corn is the world's most widely planted cereal\ncrop. But nowhere have humans done quite as much to advance the\ninterests of this plant as in North America, where zea mays has\ninsinuated itself into our landscape, our food system and our federal\nbudget.\n\nOne need look no further than the $190 billion farm bill President Bush\nsigned last month to wonder whose interests are really being served\nhere. Under the 10-year program, taxpayers will pay farmers $4 billion a\nyear to grow ever more corn, this despite the fact that we struggle to\nget rid of the surplus the plant already produces. The average bushel of\ncorn (56 pounds) sells for about $2 today; it costs farmers more than $3\nto grow it. But rather than design a program that would encourage\nfarmers to plant less corn which would have the benefit of lifting the\nprice farmers receive for it Congress has decided instead to subsidize\ncorn by the bushel, thereby insuring that zea mays dominion over its\n125,000-square mile American habitat will go unchallenged.\n\nAt first blush this subsidy might look like a handout for farmers, but\nreally it's a form of welfare for the plant itself -- and for all those\neconomic interests that profit from its overproduction: the processors,\nfactory farms, and the soft drink and snack makers that rely on cheap\ncorn. For zea mays has triumphed by making itself indispensable not to\nfarmers (whom it is swiftly and surely bankrupting) but to the Archer\nDaniels Midlands, Tysons and Coca-Colas of the world.\n\nOur entire food supply has undergone a process of \"cornification\" in\nrecent years, without our even noticing it. That's because, unlike in\nMexico, where a corn-based diet has been the norm for centuries, in the\nUnited States most of the corn we consume is invisible, having been\nheavily processed or passed through food animals before it reaches us.\nMost of the animals we eat (chickens, pigs and cows) today subsist on a\ndiet of corn, regardless of whether it is good for them. In the case of\nbeef cattle, which evolved to eat grass, a corn diet wreaks havoc on\ntheir digestive system, making it necessary to feed them antibiotics to\nstave off illness and infection. Even farm-raised salmon are being bred\nto tolerate corn  not a food their evolution has prepared them for. Why\nfeed fish corn? Because it's the cheapest thing you can feed any animal,\nthanks to federal subsidies. But even with more than half of the 10\nbillion bushels of corn produced annually being fed to animals, there is\nplenty left over. So companies like A.D.M., Cargill and ConAgra have\nfigured ingenious new ways to dispose of it, turning it into everything\nfrom ethanol to Vitamin C and biodegradable plastics.\n\nBy far the best strategy for keeping zea mays in business has been the\ndevelopment of high-fructose corn syrup, which has all but pushed sugar\naside. Since the 1980's, most soft drink manufacturers have switched\nfrom sugar to corn sweeteners, as have most snack makers. Nearly 10\npercent of the calories Americans consume now come from corn sweeteners;\nthe figure is 20 percent for many children. Add to that all the\ncorn-based animal protein (corn-fed beef, chicken and pork) and the corn\nqua corn (chips, muffins, sweet corn) and you have a plant that has\nbecome one of nature's greatest success stories, by turning us (along\nwith several other equally unwitting species) into an expanding race of\ncorn eaters.\n\nSo why begrudge corn its phenomenal success? Isn't this the way\ndomestication is supposed to work?\n\nThe problem in corn's case is that we're sacrificing the health of both\nour bodies and the environment by growing and eating so much of it.\nThough we're only beginning to understand what our cornified food system\nis doing to our health, there's cause for concern. It's probably no\ncoincidence that the wholesale switch to corn sweeteners in the 1980's\nmarks the beginning of the epidemic of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in\nthis country. Sweetness became so cheap that soft drink makers, rather\nthan lower their prices, super-sized their serving portions and\nmarketing budgets. Thousands of new sweetened snack foods hit the\nmarket, and the amount of fructose in our diets soared.\n\nThis would be bad enough for the American waistline, but there's also\npreliminary research suggesting that high-fructose corn syrup is\nmetabolized differently than other sugars, making it potentially more\nharmful. A recent study at the University of Minnesota found that a diet\nhigh in fructose (as compared to glucose) elevates triglyceride levels\nin men shortly after eating, a phenomenon that has been linked to an\nincreased risk of obesity and heart disease. Little is known about the\nhealth effects of eating animals that have themselves eaten so much\ncorn, but in the case of cattle, researchers have found that corn-fed\nbeef is higher in saturated fats than grass-fed beef.\n\nWe know a lot more about what 80 million acres of corn is doing to the\nhealth of our environment: serious and lasting damage. Modern corn\nhybrids are the greediest of plants, demanding more nitrogen fertilizer\nthan any other crop. Corn requires more pesticide than any other food\ncrop. Runoff from these chemicals finds its way into the groundwater\nand, in the Midwestern corn belt, into the Mississippi River, which\ncarries it to the Gulf of Mexico, where it has already killed off marine\nlife in a 12,000 square mile area.\n\nTo produce the chemicals we apply to our cornfields takes vast amounts\nof oil and natural gas. (Nitrogen fertilizer is made from natural gas,\npesticides from oil.) America's corn crop might look like a sustainable,\nsolar-powered system for producing food, but it is actually a huge,\ninefficient, polluting machine that guzzles fossil fuel -- a half a\ngallon of it for every bushel.\n\nSo it seems corn has indeed become king. We have given it more of our\nland than any other plant, an area more than twice the size of New York\nState. To keep it well fed and safe from predators we douse it with\nchemicals that poison our water and deepen our dependence on foreign\noil. And then in order to dispose of all the corn this cracked system\nhas produced, we eat it as fast as we can in as many ways as we can\nturning the fat of the land into, well, fat. One has to wonder whether\ncorn hasn't at last succeeded in domesticating us.\n======\nMichael Pollan is the author, most recently, of \"The Botany of Desire: A\nPlant's-Eye View of the World.\"\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
