Top of the list is <wot> (War on TerrorT). The\ntag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger\nagainst ragheads, thus:\n\n<wot>Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has\nadopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political\nopponents.</wot>\n\nOf particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new <iht> (I'm\nhurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of\nElizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people:\n\n<iht>She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her\ninstinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly\nmissed.</iht>\n\nThe instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and\nself-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset\nabout the death of a complete stranger.\n\nPolitical reporting also looks to benefit from the new <spin> tag. Any\ngovernment ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately\ntransparent:\n\n<spin>Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling\nhim \"the most honest man it has been my privilege to know\".</spin>\n\nAnd, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified\nthe controversial <nolibel>. This guarantees any text contained within\nit complete immunity from prosecution:\n\n<nolibel>Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug-addicted\nperjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling\nand obnoxious behaviour.</nolibel>\n\nThe new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C\nhas, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has\nfurther cautioned that they should never be used together, since the\neffect on the reader could be catastrophic:\n\n<wot><iht><spin>In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen\nvictim to Sadaam Hussein's Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme,\nStephen Byers noted: \"She was everybody's favourite grandmother who\ntouched the lives of billions. The only consolation we can gain from\nthis tragedy is that all of the UK's trains will be running on time by\nnext Monday. And you can quote me on that.\"</spin></iht></wot>\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
