I've been trying out RedHat Limbo for a few weeks now, \nequipped with gcc 3.1. I haven't fallen foul of compiler issue so far, \nthat I'm aware of anyhow. That said I'm glad I don't do much C++ - seems \npretty much every version of gcc (2.95, 2.96, 3.0, 3.1, and the \nforthcoming 3.2) breaks C++ binary compatibility in some way or other.\n\nPaul.\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
