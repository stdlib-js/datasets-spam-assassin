It's like the tourist on holidays using\nthat speak-loudly-enough-and-they-will-understand technique or (slightly\nless off-topic) the friend or relative who says \"I know nothing\nabout computers!\" and clearly doesn't intend to learn, and is happy\nto let you clean up after them.\n\nI certainly agree that Irish is not taught all that well (or wasn't\nwhen I was in school) but I'd like to be able to relearn it and to\ncount it as one of my skills.\n\nDavid\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
