It has been brought up that a boss no\nlonger marries his secretary.  Now the female law partner selects\nanother high earning mate (at least associate law).  So instead of two\ncouples making $140K a piece (100K + 40K) you have one pair with $200\nand one pair with $80 and this has some interesting social effects.  And\none of those effects is the difference in their children (on average).\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nKarl\n> Anderson\n> Sent: Wednesday, July 24, 2002 1:15 PM\n> To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org\n> Subject: Re: [Baseline] Raising chickens the high-tech way\n> \n> Elias Sinderson <elias@cse.ucsc.edu> writes:\n> \n> > Sorry, Karl, your confusing things.\n> \n> No, it's just a silly discussion, but that's what picky semantic\n> discussions turn into :)\n> \n> > Thos is saying that selective\n> > breeding should be counted as genetic engineering, whereas you are\n> > extending his definition to include the attration that your parents\n> felt...\n> \n> Yes, I'm saying that if he extends \"genetic engineering\" to include\n> selecting animals to breed, he must extend it to include selecting\n> people to breed with.\n> \n> > Unless your parents were selectively bred like livestock to produce\nyou,\n> > I don't think you can make that case...  :-)\n> \n> I'm saying that my parents selected each other, and that they did so\n> because (among other reasons) each wanted the other's genes to be\n> mixed with their own in the offspring that they were planning.\n> \n> What does it matter that they were selecting to produce their own\n> offspring, rather than the offspring of two unrelated animals?\n> \n> --\n> Karl Anderson      kra@monkey.org\nhttp://www.monkey.org/~kra/\n> http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
