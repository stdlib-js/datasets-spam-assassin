If not, try a hacksaw blade on the shaft of the\nscrew under the board (taking care not to scratch the underside of the\nboard. after cutting the screw, that holder on the board support structure\ncannot really be used again.\n\nAnother method is to get a small screwdriver that you can consider\ndisposable, and gently tap it into the head of the stripped screw, until\nyou either have a flat head screw, or you can get enough turning force\n on it.\n\nCathal.\n\nOn Wed, 21 Aug 2002, Kiall Mac Innes wrote:\n> Hi i have a phillips head skrew thats holding a circut board together i need\n> to take it out ASAP and nothing will work, the threads on the skrew are\n> almost completly gone, its is a very small skrew that i have to use a\n> percision skrewdriver set to remove the skrews any help would be\n> appreaciated...\n>\n> Kiall Mac Innes\n>\n>\n>\n\n-- \nCathal Ferris.\t\t\tpio@skynet.ie\n+353 87 9852077\t\t\twww.csn.ul.ie/~pio\n---\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
