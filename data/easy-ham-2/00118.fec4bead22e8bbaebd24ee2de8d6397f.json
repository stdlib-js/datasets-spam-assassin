Might save you serious\nhassle down the line. \n\nOnly kidding but thats what I would do.\n\nCW\n\n----------------\nOK, Here's how to do it [1] ...\n\nWhile the disk is still installed in the i686 machine (if that's broken,\nbeg, borrow or steal...), remove the i686 versions of glibc and kernel and\ninstall the i386 versions.  This will break one or two other packages since\nthey have entries in /etc/ld.so.conf which belongs to glibc.  these packages\nwill need to be reinstalled.  So:\n\n1. rpm -e --nodeps glibc\n\n\tYour /etc/ld.so.conf has been saved as /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave\n\n2. rpm -ivh glibc-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm\n3. rpm -e --nodeps kernel\n4. rpm -ivh kernel-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm\n\nThis installs the i386 versions of kernel and glibc.  You'll be able to boot\nin a non 686 machine now.  However, X is now broken as is kerberos.  At\nleast those are the two I noticed.  Your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave will\ncontain clues as to what else might be broken.  To fix X and kerberos you\nneed to reinstall their libs (copying /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave back to\n/etc/ld.so.conf doesn't seem to work):\n\n1. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs XFree86-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm\n2. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs krb5-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm\n\nfixes them.  Other libs listed in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt, mysql and\nsane.  If they start behaving in odd fashions, it may be related.\nReinstalling the libs for these packages may fix that.\n\nThanks guys...\n\n> [snip]\n> \n> > > [I] wouldn't bog it down with X either.\n> >\n> > That's a thought but it may be useful for the server to be available as\na\n> > user machine also (maybe staff only, maybew admin only).

I plan to have the server mail me its\nlogs and stuff regurlarly so I can keep an eye on it but most/all of the\nadmin will be done locally.\n\nConor\n\n[1] \"it\" being migrate a Hard Disk from an Intel P3/4/celeron box to an AMD\nK6-x box.  Essentially, the P3/4/celeron processor is an i686 class while\nthe AMD K6 processor is an i586 class (not sure about the AMD athlon or\nduron chips).  A RHL installed on the i686 class machine will not boot on an\ni586 calss box since both kernel and glibc are optimised for i686.  The\nsolution is to replace the i686 kernel and glibc with i386 versions.\n-- \nConor Daly \nMet Eireann, Glasnevin Hill, Dublin 9, Ireland\nPh +353 1 8064276 Fax +353 1 8064247\n------------------------------------\nbofh.irmet.ie running RedHat Linux 10:27am  up 8 days, 23:57,  5 users,\nload average: 0.19, 0.30, 0.49\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they\nare addressed.
