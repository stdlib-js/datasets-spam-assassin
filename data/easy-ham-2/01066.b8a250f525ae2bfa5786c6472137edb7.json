Bullshit meter red-lining again...\n\n\nYou aren't the first person to ask this question, but over the last few\nyears there have been some good answers to this coming from the genetics\nresearch folks.  As I understand it, there is a growing body of genetic\nevidence that European immune systems are substantially tougher and more\nresistant to a wider range of infectious diseases than those found in other\npeoples around the world, including a surprisingly wide range of hereditary\nimmunities and partial immunities/resistance to common viruses and bacteria\nfound around the world.  As a result, when the first wholesale mixing of\npeople from different parts of the world started occurring on a regular\nbasis, the Europeans fared much better than most others.\n\nThe standard theory for this is that Europe was the first major region of\nthe planet to become densely populated and urbanized (to the extent that\nthey \"urbanized\" a thousand years ago).  Because of this, Europe was a\nfestering cauldron of disease without the benefit of modern sanitation and\nmedicine for a thousand plus years, much more so than the rest of the world\nand suffered from repeated large-scale epidemics and plagues that took\nsevere tolls on the population.  Modern ethnic Europeans have genetics that\nsurvived a unique and brutal culling process by a rather extensive range of\ndiseases over dozens of generations.\n\nWhat the geneticists are discovering is that for a great many of the world's\nmost common infectious diseases, there is a percentage of the ethnically\nEuropean population that has hereditary immunity and an even larger segment\nthat has at least some hereditary resistance compared to people from other\nparts of the world.  And for most ethnic Europeans it isn't just one\ndisease, they have varying levels of genetic resistance to a veritable\ncornucopia of infectious diseases.  Because of similarities in the\nmechanisms and characteristics of viruses and other pathogens around the\nworld to ones that Europeans were exposed to, the robust defenses their\ngenetics provided them against their native diseases frequently imparted\nsome resistance to diseases which they had never been exposed.\n\nCheers,\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
