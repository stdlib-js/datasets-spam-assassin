The correct \nbehavior would be to unsubscribe razor-users@fsckit.net from the mailing \nlist.\n\nBut in any case, you have to understand that you and him would not be \nthe only one involved. As I said in a another thread, you probably get \nhurt only if you are against the majority of people (which makes sense). \nIf you are with the majority, you get a bonus (which also makes sense). \nIf there is no majority, nobody wins or lose.\nRazor is designed for the betterment of most people, i.e. the majority, \nnot for the individual. If one doesn't agree with the majority, he \nshould use the razor-whitelist or create a blacklist (BTW, why doesn't \nrazor provide a razor-blacklist too?)\n\n\tJehan\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nRazor-users mailing list\nRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users\n\n\n"}
