People in council houses are 'worthless and lazy'.\nRamblers are 'nosy perverts'. Nicholas van Hoogstraten, a man who once paid\nfor a hand-grenade attack on a business rival, shows Emma Brockes around his\nSussex palace and explains why he's so keen to keep the riff-raff away\n\nFriday September 8, 2000\n...\nOn the way down from the roof, through the \"workers' quarters\" which Van\nHoogstraten intends to fill with staff from Zimbabwe, he returns to the\nsubject of peasants, expanding on the \"worthless\" and \"lazy\" majority who\nmake up the council estates of this country. \"You are playing up to your\nvillainous image,\" I suggest. Van Hoogstraten looks momentarily embarrassed.\n\"I'm not villainous,\" he mumbles. I ask if he regards the people who work\nfor him in these derogatory terms, and he says no, because they work hard\nand hard labour is what distinguishes the \"riff-raff\" from the \"elite\". I\nask him if being a person of quality is merely a matter of wealth. He says\nno, and refers to some of his wealthy neighbours, \"old-moneyed bastards\"\nwhom he regards as being as primitive in their idleness as \"those rat bags\ndrawing social security.\"\n\n...\nHe was in the Bahamas when President John F Kennedy was shot, and amidst the\npublic mourning, remembers being pleased. \"I was glad,\" he says. \"He was\nonly in it for the ego trip.\" He claims similar feelings on hearing news of\nDiana's death, while returning from France on a ferry. \"She made us look\nlike fools,\" he says. \"She made a mockery of the royal family.\"\nVan Hoogstraten's relationship with authority is riddled with\ncontradictions. He says he hated Diana because she was thick, but when you\npoint out that the rest of the royal family are pretty thick too, he says\ngloopily, \"they are all we've got, so we have to respect them.\" He says he\nfavours dictatorship as the best form of government, but complains that some\nof the officials he has dealt with in Mugabe's Zimbabwe are impossible\nbecause \"the power has gone to their heads.\" (Mugabe himself is the most\nmodest man he has ever met, he says, and he is friends with Ian Smith, who\napart from the small matter of his hysterical racism, he finds charming).\nMargaret Thatcher is the only leader he has ever admired, because she made\nhim feel \"proud to be English\".\n...\n\nThe 'van' is of course a late affectation - always an indication of a\ngenuine dickhead.
