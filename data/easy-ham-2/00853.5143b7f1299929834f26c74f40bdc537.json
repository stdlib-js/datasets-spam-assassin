All they have to do is use some program (which, if\nthey don't exist already, will certainly be around someday soon) that makes\nevery spam they send show the recipient as the \"from\" address as well.\n\n>> Plus, I'm still not sure how I feel about whitelists.

And, anytime I speak\nto someone new, it just makes it more unlikely that they will be willing to\ncontact me.  Having played around with whitelists in the past, you'd be\namazed at how confused many people get by them as well.  They tend to\nignore the \"please apply\" messages.\n\nAs an aside, am I the only person around who simply does not use the\naddressbook feature in email programs?  I never have, and I don't see any\nreason to.  It (along with not opening attachments) has helped me not to\nsend out viruses to people.  I generally use my own brain or my inbox as an\naddressbook, and search out the last email I received from someone and hit\nreply...\n\n>> email.

They're a pain.\n\nWell, yes.  *I* use one email address, but that doesn't mean all my friends\ndo.  You would need to convince everyone I know of that.  Most people I\nknow, at the very least, have a home and work email address.  But plenty\nothers have other addresses for various reasons.  Keeping track of all of\nthem for a whitelist seems like a pain.  It forces them to remember which\nemail addresses are already approved and avoid using others.\n\nPlus, I know plenty of people who change jobs, and suddenly get a new email\naddress from their new job.  Wouldn't it suck if, in sending out your new\njob info, you had to fill out a new application for each friend just to\ntell them about your new job email address?\n\n -Mike\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
