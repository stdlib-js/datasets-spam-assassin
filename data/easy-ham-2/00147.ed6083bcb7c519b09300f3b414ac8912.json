Of course once\nyou've memorised (not necessarily sitting down with a sheet of them\nand learning them off by rote) them, you wonder what all the fuss is\nabout before.\n\nIt's not in itself a reason to choose one firewall product over\nanother, but if that's all there is in the difference, and the\nlearning curve for the Operating System is the same, then I know\nwhat I'd prefer, as a beginner.\n\nThis is all getting rather off-topic now anyways, but since I've\nbeen doing quite a lot of work with ipfw over the last week I jumped\non the bandwagon.\n\n-- \n  Philip Reynolds        \n   RFC Networks          tel: 01 8832063\nwww.rfc-networks.ie      fax: 01 8832041\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
