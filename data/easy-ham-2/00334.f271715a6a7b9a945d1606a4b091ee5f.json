Martin Dalecki seems\nto have been unable to further development without \nmuch breakage. However, this is part of the fun of\nthe development kernel. Alan and others are annoyed\nbecause they can't do any development themselves while\nIDE is broken. Hopefully the 2.4 IDE port should help.\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
