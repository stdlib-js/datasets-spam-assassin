The place was hopping\nwith music and dancing but every once in a while the lights would\nturn off.  Each time after the lights would go out the place would\nerupt into cheers.\n\nHowever, when the revelers saw the town pastor, the room went dead\nsilent.  He walked up to the bartender and asked, \"May I please\nuse the restroom?\"\n\nThe bartender replied, \"I really don't think you should.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the pastor asked.\n\n\"Well, there is a statue of a naked woman in there, and her most\nprivate part is covered only by a fig leaf.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said the pastor, \"I'll just look the other way.\"\n\nSo the bartender showed the clergyman the door at the top of the\nstairs, and he proceeded to the restroom.  After a few minutes, he\ncame back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and\ndancing again.  However, they did stop just long enough to give\nthe pastor a loud round of applause.  He went to the bartender and\nsaid, \"Sir, I don't understand.  Why did they applaud for me just\nbecause I went to the restroom?\"\n\n\"Well, now they know you're one of us,\" said the bartender.  \"Would\nyou like a drink?\"\n\n\"But, I still don't understand,\" said the puzzled pastor.\n\n\"You see,\" laughed the bartender, \"every time the fig leaf is lifted\non the statue, the lights go out in the whole place.  Now, how\nabout that drink?\"\n\n\n"}
