He'd planned to show (Infoworld) how a\nDVD player with its regional coding disabled could play DVDs with\ndifferent regional codes.\n\nPerens was going to do this in violation, he believed, of the Digital\nMillennium Copyright Act, which bans the circumvention of technological\nmethods to protect copyrighted material from uses the owner doesn't want.\nAnd the possibility of legal trouble led his employer, Hewlett-Packard, to\nask him not to do the demonstration.\n\nHP funds Perens to pursue a variety of free software projects. He was\nwilling to take the legal risks himself, he told me today, but HP worried\nthat it would be \"a more juicy target,\" the kind of deep pockets that\nmight make the entertainment cartel drool. In that context it's\nunderstandable why HP would be concerned, though I wish the company would\ntake a stand on the right side of this issue.\n\nSo while Perens is going to talk about the DMCA's pernicious impact on\nthings like free software, he's not going to give his demonstration. A\nshame, but that's how things are going these days.\n\nHollywood is winning, folks. You are losing. And you'd better start caring\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
