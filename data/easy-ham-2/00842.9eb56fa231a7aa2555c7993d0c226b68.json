As no less than TEN \nforkers pointed out, the invitation, while sent on Sunday 6/30, was only \ndelivered ten days later on 7/9.\n\nIt got flagged as spam.\n\nYes, on a mailing list awash in crap -- and some it is even unsolicited \ncommercial email, heavens! -- our trusty mailman filters captured and \nquarantined just two posts that week, one from me that was > 100K (the \nfat articles) and one that was bcc:d (the invite).\n\nNow, it was a little difficult to recalibrate self-esteem, which as you \ncan imagine was proportional to the two-digit attendance  -- in binary!\n\nAccording to the George Washington documentary, I almost had as much \nalcohol on hand than he did -- Virginia tradition being to copiously \nlubricate each voter. Election day was a public festival day, and it \ncost poor George an average of SIXTY-FOUR shots of hard liquor PER VOTER \nthat day...\n\nSo, herewith is the prize for most appropriate flame my delayed invite \ngot:\n\n> \tI unfortunately will have had other plans and thus will\n> \tnot be able to have made it.

(as \n> the Japanese would say).\n>\n> Fuck.\n> Fuck.\n> Fuck.\n> Fuck.\n> Fuck.\n> Fuck.\n\nPerhaps I should remind the latter gently that it was not in any way his \nfault. The universe *was* out to get him!\n\nAnd finally, here's an object lesson for all ye of little faith to learn \nfrom my sins:\n\n> SpamAssassin rated it spam (barely). Gotta stop\n> using those \"words and phrases which indicate porn\" :-)\n\nYes, boys and girls, Mr. Assassin, like Mr. Lott, gets very annoyed if \nyou call the Great American Shrine a... \"boob tube\"\n\n:-)\n   Rohit\n\nPS. This is the obscure footnote where I actually hide the bits in this \npost. What we just encountered here is that an event-processing system \nwith a 10-day RTT cannot be used to reliably handle events more often \nthan once every 20 days. That's why I waited to reply. six bonus points \nto anyone who can prove this hunch of mine. Hint: try analyzing the \nproblem in frequency-domain.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
