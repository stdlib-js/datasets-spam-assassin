The administration is here making the case that Americans don't even have a right to question government secrecy.\n\nWe may find that the history of this past year has been an epic looting from the public, made possible by the urgency of reacting to 9/11.\n\n\nluke@applix.com\n\n\nAfter Sept. 11, a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil Liberty\n\nAugust 4, 2002\nBy THE NEW YORK TIMES \n\n\n\n\n \n\nThis article was reported and written by Adam Liptak, Neil\nA. Lewis and Benjamin Weiser. \n\nIn the fearful aftermath of Sept. 11, Attorney General John\nAshcroft vowed to use the full might of the federal\ngovernment and \"every available statute\" to hunt down and\npunish \"the terrorists among us.\" \n\nThe roundup that followed the attacks, conducted with\nwartime urgency and uncommon secrecy, led to the detentions\nof more than 1,200 people suspected of violating\nimmigration laws, being material witnesses to terrorism or\nfighting for the enemy. \n\nThe government's effort has produced few if any law\nenforcement coups. Most of the detainees have since been\nreleased or deported, with fewer than 200 still being held.\n\n\nBut it has provoked a sprawling legal battle, now being\nwaged in federal courthouses around the country, that\nexperts say has begun to redefine the delicate balance\nbetween individual liberties and national security. \n\nThe main combatants are the attorney general and federal\nprosecutors on one side and a network of public defenders,\nimmigration and criminal defense lawyers, civil\nlibertarians and some constitutional scholars on the other,\nwith federal judges in between. \n\nThe government's record has so far been decidedly mixed. As\nit has pushed civil liberties protections to their limits,\nthe courts, particularly at the trial level, have pushed\nback, stopping well short of endorsing Mr. Ashcroft's\ntactics or the rationales he has offered to justify them.\nFederal judges have, however, allowed the government to\nhold two American citizens without charges in military\nbrigs, indefinitely, incommunicado and without a road map\nfor how they might even challenge their detentions. \n\nIn the nation's history, the greatest battles over the\nreach of government power have occurred against the\nbackdrop of wartime. Some scholars say the current\nrestrictions on civil liberties are relatively minor by\nhistorical standards and in light of the risks the nation\nfaces. \n\nThe current struggle centers on three sets of issues.\nPeople held simply for immigration violations have objected\nto new rules requiring that their cases be heard in secret,\nand they have leveraged those challenges into an attack on\nwhat they call unconstitutional preventive detentions. \n\nPeople brought in and jailed as material witnesses, those\nthought to have information about terrorist plots, have\nargued that they should not be held to give testimony in\ngrand jury investigations. \n\nFinally, Yasser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla, the two\nAmericans labeled \"enemy combatants\" for what the\ngovernment contends is more direct involvement with\nterrorist groups, are seeking rights once thought to be\nfundamental to American citizens, like a lawyer's\nrepresentation and a chance to challenge their detentions\nbefore a civilian judge. \n\nSo far, federal judges in Newark and Detroit have ordered\nsecret deportation proceedings opened to public scrutiny,\nand on Friday a federal district judge in Washington\nordered that the identities of most of the detainees be\nmade public under the Freedom of Information Act. \n\n\"Secret arrests,\" Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in the\ndecision on Friday, \"are a concept odious to a democratic\nsociety.\" \n\nA senior Justice Department official said the detentions\nhad been lawful and effective. He said it was hard to\n\"prove a negative\" and cite specific terrorist acts that\nhad been disrupted. But he said that department officials\nbelieved that the detentions had \"incapacitated and\ndisrupted some ongoing terrorist plans.\" \n\nTwo federal judges in New York have differed sharply on\nwhether the government may jail material witnesses while\nthey wait to testify in grand jury investigations. In\nVirginia, a federal judge ordered the government to allow\nMr. Hamdi to consult a lawyer. \n\n\"I look at the federal district court judges and just cheer\nthem on, because they are doing exactly what an independent\njudiciary should be doing,\" said Jane E. Kirtley, a\nprofessor at the University of Minnesota and former\nexecutive director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom\nof the Press. \"It's not hostile or adversarial; it's simply\nskeptical.\" \n\nThese lower-court decisions have for the most part not yet\nbeen tested on appeal, and there is reason to think that\nappeals courts and the Supreme Court will prove more\nsympathetic to the government's tactics and arguments. \n\nThe federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., for instance,\nreversed the decision to allow Mr. Hamdi to talk to a\nlawyer and ordered the lower court judge to consider\nadditional evidence and arguments. \n\nBut even the appeals court seemed torn, and it rejected the\ngovernment's sweeping argument that the courts have no role\nin reviewing the government's designation of an American\ncitizen as an enemy combatant. \n\nThe detention issues also carry an emotional punch. Many of\nthe Arabs and Muslims caught in the government dragnet were\ncabdrivers, construction workers or other types of\nlaborers, and some spent up to seven months in jail before\nbeing cleared of terrorism ties and deported or released. \n\nLast month, at a conference held by a federal appeals\ncourt, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state in the\nClinton administration, snapped at Viet Dinh, an assistant\nattorney general under President Bush, saying that the\nadministration's refusal to identify the people it had\ndetained reminded him of the \"disappeareds\" in Argentina. \n\n\"I'll never forget going to Argentina and seeing the\nmothers marching in the streets asking for the names of\nthose being held by the government,\" Mr. Christopher said.\n\"We must be very careful in this country about taking\npeople into custody without revealing their names.\" \n\nMr. Dinh, who came to the United States as a refugee from\nVietnam, recalled his family's anguish when his father was\ntaken away in 1975 for \"re-education.\" In contrast, he\nsaid, those detained by the United States were not being\nsecretly held but were allowed to go to the press and seek\nlawyers. \n\n\"These are not incognito detentions,\" he said. \"The only\nthing we will not do is provide a road map for the\ninvestigations.\" \n\nAccording to the Justice Department, 752 of the more than\n1,200 people detained since Sept. 11 were held on\nimmigration charges. Officials said recently that 81\nremained in detention. Court papers indicate there were\nabout two dozen material witnesses, while most of the other\ndetainees were held on various state and federal criminal\ncharges. \n\nPresident Bush also has announced plans to try suspected\nforeign terrorists before military tribunals, though no\nsuch charges have been brought yet. \n\nLast month, William G. Young, the federal judge presiding\nin Boston over the criminal case against Richard C. Reid, a\nBritish citizen accused of trying to detonate a bomb in his\nshoe on a trans-Atlantic flight, noted that the very\nestablishment of those tribunals \"has the effect of\ndiminishing the American jury, once the central feature of\nAmerican justice.\" \n\nJudge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan,\nadded: \"This is the most profound shift in our legal\ninstitutions in my lifetime and - most remarkable of all -\nit has taken place without engaging any broad public\ninterest whatsoever.\" \n\nJack Goldsmith and Cass R. Sunstein, professors at the\nUniversity of Chicago Law School, have written that the\nBush administration's policies are a minimal challenge to\ncivil liberties especially compared with changes during the\ntimes of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. What\nhas changed, they say, is a greater sensitivity to civil\nliberties and a vast increase in mistrust of government. \n\nThe Secrecy \n\nU.S. Says Hearings \nAre Not Trials \n\nTen days\nafter last September's attacks, Michael J. Creppy, the\nnation's chief immigration judge, quietly issued sweeping\ninstructions to hundreds of judges for what would turn out\nto be more than 600 \"special interest\" immigration cases. \n\n\"Each of these cases is to be heard separately from all\nother cases on the docket,\" Judge Creppy wrote. \"The\ncourtroom must be closed for these cases - no visitors, no\nfamily, and no press.\" \n\n\"This restriction,\" he continued, \"includes confirming or\ndenying whether such a case is on the docket.\" \n\nThe government has never formally explained how it decided\nwhich visa violators would be singled out for this\nextraordinary process, and it has insisted that the\ndesignations could not be reviewed by the courts. \n\nBut as it turns out, most of these cases involved Arab and\nMuslim men who were detained in fairly haphazard ways, for\nexample at traffic stops or through tips from suspicious\nneighbors. Law enforcement officials have acknowledged that\nonly a few of these detainees had any significant\ninformation about possible terrorists. \n\nAs the ruling on Friday in Washington suggests, a series of\nlegal challenges to this secrecy has resulted in striking\nlegal setbacks for the administration. Several courts have\nordered the proceedings opened and have voiced considerable\nskepticism about the government's justifications for its\ndetention policies generally. \n\nLee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties\nUnion, said the secrecy of the proceedings exacerbated the\nhardships faced by people who disappeared from sight on\nviolations that in the past would not have resulted in\nincarceration. \n\n\"Preventive detention,\" he said, \"is such a radical\ndeparture from constitutional traditions that we certainly\nshouldn't be undertaking it solely on the Justice\nDepartment's say-so.\" \n\nMalek Zeidan's detention would have been unexceptional had\nit not given rise to one of the legal challenges that\nthreatens to end the secret proceedings. \n\nMr. Zeidan, 42, is a Syrian citizen who overstayed his visa\n14 years ago and has lived in Paterson, N.J., for more than\na decade. Over the years, he has delivered pizzas, driven\nan ice cream truck and pumped gas. When the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service came around last Jan. 31 to ask him\nabout a former roommate suspected of marriage fraud, Mr.\nZeidan was working at Dunkin' Donuts, and his expired visa\nsoon cost him 40 days in custody. \n\nWhen a hearing was finally held three weeks after his\ndetention, the judge closed the courtroom, excluding Mr.\nZeidan's cousin and reporters. \n\nThe closing of proceedings prompted lawsuits in federal\ncourt, from both Mr. Zeidan and two New Jersey newspapers.\nIn March, the government dropped the \"special interest\"\ndesignation, Mr. Zeiden was released after posting a bond,\nand the case he filed was dismissed. The immigration\ncharges against him will be considered in the fall. \n\n\"You're one of the lucky ones,\" his lawyer, Regis\nFernandez, recalls telling Mr. Zeidan, given that other\nvisa violators were held as long as six or seven months\nbefore being deported or released. \n\nMr. Zeidan's lawyers believe that their legal strategy,\nwhich focused on openness, forced the government's hand. \n\n\"The government was somehow linking secrecy to guilt,\" Mr.\nFernandez said. \"We figured if the public had access to\nthese hearings they would see that nothing went on except\nmultiple adjournments and delay.\" \n\nThrough a spokeswoman, Judge Creppy declined to comment. An\nI.N.S. official, who spoke on the condition that he not be\nnamed, said the agency had acted properly in Mr. Zeidan's\ncase and in similar cases. \n\nHe said the immigration service had always detained people\nwithout bond who were linked to criminal investigations. He\nadded that the agency had no choice now but to detain a\nvisa violator until the Federal Bureau of Investigation was\nsure the person was not involved in terrorism. \n\n\"Consider the flip side - that you held him for two days\nand then deported him, and 30 days later you found out he\nwas a terrorist,\" the official said. \n\nThe newspapers' lawsuit has continued. It has already once\nreached the Supreme Court, and the government's papers\ncontain one of the fullest accounts of its position on\nsecrecy and executive power. \n\nIts main argument is that the courts have no role because\nimmigration hearings are not really trials, but are merely\nadministrative hearings that can be closed at will. \n\nBennet Zurofsky, who also represented Mr. Zeidan, said he\nwas flabbergasted by this suggestion. \n\n\"A trial is a trial,\" he said. \"A person's liberty is at\nstake. A person is being held in jail. A person is being\ntold where to live.\" \n\nBut in a sworn statement submitted in several court cases,\nDale L. Watson, the executive assistant director for\ncounterterrorism and counterintelligence at the F.B.I.,\noutlined the reasoning behind the government demand for\ntotal secrecy. \n\n\"Bits and pieces of information that may appear innocuous\nin isolation can be fit into a bigger picture by terrorist\ngroups,\" he said. \n\nThis rationale for withholding information, sometimes\ncalled the mosaic theory, is controversial. \n\n\"It's impossible to refute,\" Professor Kirtley said,\n\"because who can say with certainty that it's not true?\" \n\nIn May, John W. Bissell, the chief judge of the federal\ndistrict court in Newark, appointed by President Reagan,\nruled for the newspapers and ordered all deportation\nhearings nationwide to be opened, unless the government is\nable to show a need for a closed hearing on a case-by-case\nbasis. His ruling followed a similar one in Detroit the\nmonth before, though that case involved only a single\ndetainee. \n\nThe government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit, in Philadelphia, and asked it to block Judge\nBissell's order until the appeal was decided. The court,\nwhich will hear arguments in September, declined to do\nthat. A number of news organizations, including The New\nYork Times, filed a brief as a friend of the court in\nsupport of the newspapers. \n\nThe government then asked the United States Supreme Court\nto stay Judge Bissell's order. The court, in a relatively\nunusual move given that the case was not before it for any\nother purpose, blocked Judge Bissell's order, suggesting\nthat it might have more sympathy for the government's\narguments. \n\nThe Witnesses \n\nRights Violated, \nLawyers Contend \n\nLate on Sept. 12, federal agents pulled\ntwo nervous Indian men, Mohammed Jaweed Azmath and Syed Gul\nMohammed Shah, off an Amtrak train near Fort Worth. They\nwere carrying box cutters, black hair dye and about $5,000\nin cash and had also shaved their body hair. \n\nThe agents' suspicions were obvious. The hijackers had used\nbox cutters and knives to take control of the aircraft and\nhad received letters instructing them to \"shave excess hair\nfrom the body.\" An F.B.I. affidavit dated Sept. 15 said\nthere was probable cause to believe that both of the Indian\nmen were involved in, or \"were associated\" with, those\nresponsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. \n\nBut even though government officials told reporters that\nthe men had been detained as material witnesses, their\nlawyers now say that they were held last fall only on\nimmigration violations. \n\nThe distinction is important because a material witness\nwarrant brings the automatic appointment of a\ngovernment-paid lawyer, while the government does not have\nto supply a visa violator with counsel. \n\nAs a result, the authorities were able to question each of\nthe men repeatedly about terrorism without a lawyer\npresent, their current lawyers say. \n\nLike some of the people who were picked up as material\nwitnesses, the Indian men were held in isolation in jails\nin New York for extended periods. It was 91 days before Mr.\nAzmath received a lawyer and 57 days before Mr. Shah did,\ntheir lawyers say. \n\n\"It's wrong to keep a man in jail for 57 days and never\nbring him before a magistrate to advise him of his rights,\"\nMr. Shah's lawyer, Lawrence K. Feitell, said in an\ninterview. \"It's wrong not to provide him with an attorney\nat the threshold. It's wrong to depict this as an I.N.S.\ninvestigation, when in truth and in fact, it's the main\ninquiry into the World Trade Center debacle.\" \n\nAnthony L. Ricco, the lawyer for Mr. Azmath, said his\nclient was interrogated \"often times for several hours a\nday, with multiple interviewers, getting rapid-fire\nquestions from three or four different people.\" \n\nEventually, the F.B.I. and the prosecutors cleared the men\nof any involvement in terrorism, and both pleaded guilty in\nJune in a credit-card fraud scheme and are awaiting\nsentencing. \n\nFederal prosecutors said in court papers that both men\nconsented to questioning. Each \"was read and waived his\nMiranda rights before each interview,\" prosecutors wrote,\nadding that each man confessed to the credit card offenses.\n\n\nThe United States attorney in Manhattan, James B. Comey,\nwould not comment on the specific cases, but said generally\nof the government's tactics: \"I don't see any violation of\nany rule, regulation, or law. \n\n\"I can understand defense lawyers not being happy,\" he\nsaid. \"But I know our position after 9/11 was to use every\navailable tool, to stay within the rules but play the whole\nfield and recognize the boundaries, but cover the whole\nfield. \n\n\"We need to do whatever we can that's legal to investigate\nand disrupt,\" he added. \n\nToday, it is believed that only a handful of the two dozen\nmaterial witnesses, perhaps as few as two, are still being\ndetained. \n\nBut the process of detaining the witnesses has stirred\nintense criticism. \n\nLast April, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District\nCourt in Manhattan ruled that the use of the law \"to detain\npeople who are presumed innocent under our Constitution in\norder to prevent potential crimes is an illegitimate use of\nthe statute.\" \n\nJudge Scheindlin said the material witness law applied when\nwitnesses were held to give testimony at trials, not for\ngrand jury investigations. \"Since 1789,\" Judge Scheindlin\nsaid, \"no Congress has granted the government the authority\nto imprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that\nhe will testify before a grand jury conducting a criminal\ninvestigation.\" \n\nThen last month, Chief Judge Michael B. Mukasey, also of\nFederal District Court in Manhattan, upheld the\ngovernment's use of the material witness statute in grand\njury investigations, criticizing Judge Scheindlin's\nreasoning. \n\nJudge Mukasey, citing the assertion in 1807 by Chief\nJustice John Marshall that \"the public has a right to every\nman's evidence,\" held that detentions of material witnesses\nduring investigations are proper. \n\nThe War Captives \n\nNo Lawyers Allowed \nUnder U.S. Label \n\nYasser Esam Hamdi, a\nSaudi national who was captured in Afghanistan, is probably\nan American citizen by virtue of having been born in\nLouisiana. His case represents the core issue of what kind\nof role the nation's courts should have, if any, in\nreviewing the government's imprisonment of someone charged\nwith something akin to a war crime. \n\nProsecutors will be back in Federal District Court in\nNorfolk, Va., next Thursday to confront one of the federal\njudges who has shown resistance to the government's\napproach that once someone is declared an \"enemy combatant\"\nby the president, all judicial review ceases. \n\nJudge Robert G. Doumar, an appointee of President Reagan,\nhas twice ruled that Mr. Hamdi is entitled to a lawyer and\nordered the government to allow Frank Dunham, the federal\npublic defender, to be allowed to visit him without\ngovernment officials or listening devices. Judge Doumar\nsaid that \"fair play and fundamental justice\" require it.\nHe said the government \"could not cite one case where a\nprisoner of any variety within the jurisdiction of a United\nStates District Court, who was held incommunicado and\nindefinitely.\" \n\nBut the three-judge panel of the appeals court stayed Judge\nDoumar's order, saying he had not fully considered the\ngovernment's needs to keep Mr. Hamdi incommunicado and,\nmore important, the executive branch's primacy in areas of\nforeign and military affairs. \n\n\"The authority to capture those who take up arms against\nAmerica belongs to the commander in chief,\" Chief Judge J.\nHarvie Wilkinson 3rd wrote for the appeals panel. \n\nBut even Judge Wilkinson seemed to evince some surprise at\nthe breadth of what the government was asserting when he\nasked the Justice Department's lawyer, \"You are saying that\nthe judiciary has no right to inquire at all into someone's\nstature as an enemy combatant?\" \n\nThe government has relented slightly, agreeing to provide\nthe court with a sealed declaration of the criteria by\nwhich they have judged Mr. Hamdi to be an enemy combatant.\nBut the government has argued that judges cannot argue with\nthe standards. \n\nJudge Doumar has indicated that he will question the\ngovernment closely on those standards. \n\nThe case of Jose Padilla, which has not progressed as far\nas that of Mr. Hamdi, may present an even greater challenge\nto normal judicial procedures. \n\nMr. Padilla, also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, is, like\nMr. Hamdi, an American citizen, imprisoned in a naval brig\nafter having been declared an enemy combatant. But unlike\nMr. Hamdi, Mr. Padilla was not arrested on the battlefield\nby the military but on United States soil by civil law\nenforcement authorities, on May 8 in Chicago. \n\nAfter his detention as a material witness based on\nsuspicions that he was seeking to obtain material and\ninformation to build a radioactive bomb, he was transferred\nto military custody. \n\n\"This is the model we all fear or should fear,\" said Mr.\nDunham, the public defender. \"The executive branch can\narrest an American citizen here and then declare him an\nenemy combatant and put him outside the reach of the\ncourts. They can keep him indefinitely without charging him\nor giving him access to a lawyer or presenting any\nevidence.\"\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/04/national/04CIVI.html?ex=1029550865&ei=1&en=c82350bcf915e44e\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
