What does matter\nis that they were going on phenotypes,\nand didn't engineer the genetics.  That\nexample makes a good case for natural\nselection, but not for artificial.\n\n(do \"married people live longer\" because\nof the benefits of matrimony, or because\nacceptable health is one of the qualities\nselected for in spouses?)\n\nOf course, if there are FoRKs with six\nor fewer biological great grandparents\n(or who are offspring of Wilt) I should\neat my words; otherwise, the micro/macro\ndistinction seems much more relevant.\n\n-Dave\n\n> I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing\n> against any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument -\n> \"we've been doing it since prehistory, so we don't need to apply any\n> caution today\".\n\nOne can also view that argument as a case\nfor checks: livestock owners have, over a\nperiod of millenia, altered the genetics\nof their herds to be dumber, meatier, and\nmore tolerant of industrial living, so if\ncaution is in order, they are some of the\nleast likely people to volunteer it.\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
