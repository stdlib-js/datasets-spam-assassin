Basically I added an agument to \nClearCurrent and updated all callers to slap in $ftoc(curLine). I \nalso flipped the order in  Msg_Change to ClearCurrent $prevline after \nthe Mh_SetCur. For some reason it barfs when Marking many messages \nUnread. I'll check that tomorrow.\n\nG'night.\n\n/Anders\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n\n"}
