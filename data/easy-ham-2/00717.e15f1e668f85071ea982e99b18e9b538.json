But most\nof them can't recall the experience because the memory is so painful\nthat they've buried it deep in their subconscious minds.\n\nBut there are strong tip-offs that you may be one of the millions who\nhave encountered beings from another planet, if you know what to watch\nfor.\n\nExperts at Wake Forest University here, as well as other respected\ninstitutions around the world, offer 20 startling new indicators that\nyou may have had a close encounter:\n\n1. You experience unexplained nausea or a strange sense of uneasiness\naround the same time each day.\n\n2. You have an unusual new scar or strange mark on your body --\nparticularly on the roof of your mouth or behind an ear.\n\n3. You often find yourself hungry for oranges or lemons -- even after\nyou've had a large meal or eaten enough food to fill your\nstomach. Researchers at Oslo University say this hunger for citrus is\ncommon in alien abductees.\n\n4. You have a strong, ever-present feeling that there is some mission\nor important thing you're supposed to do in life and you find yourself\nconstantly driven to achieve it or discover what it might be.\n\n5. You often find yourself going through your trash, or the trash of\nothers, without knowing exactly what you're looking for. Swiss UFO\nresearchers found that people who have been abducted often find\nthemselves unaccountably digging through refuse.\n\n6. You frequently dream of cattle. Psychologists at the University of\nParis say it's common for the subconscious mind to substitute a cow or\nbull for an alien being.\n\n7. You feel you're \"special\" or \"chosen.\"\n\n8. You are a vegetarian -- but can't exactly explain why.\n\n9. You have an overpowering feeling of dread when you see photos or\ndrawings of space aliens.\n\n10. You are prone to addictive or compulsive behavior. This in itself\nis not necessarily indicative of alien abduction. But if there are\nother indicators as well, you could be an abductee.\n\n11. You wet the bed. Studies in Peru show there's a connection.\n\n12. You have frequent insomnia.\n\n13. You are strangely intrigued by old western movies. Psychologists\nsay they can't yet explain abductees' fascination with cowboy movies,\nbut they say it exists in at least 75 percent of victims.\n\n14. Electronic devices often go haywire around you for no discernible\nreason.\n\n15. You have seen -- or think you've seen -- a mysterious, hooded\nfigure in or near your home more than once.\n\n16. Your fingers are stiff, numb or unresponsive for more than an hour\nafter you wake up.\n\n17. You have had -- or currently have -- severe back or neck problems.\n\n18. You frequently experience a ringing in one ear.\n\n19. You often get sinusitis or other nasal pain.\n\n20. You are frequently haunted by the sense that you're being watched.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\nBusiness Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com\n\"Computers are useless.
