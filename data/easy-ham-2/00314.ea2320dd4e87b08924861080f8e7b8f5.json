It's tres sweet.\n\nI would recommend getting wvdial, opening a virtual terminal dialing the internet and then emerging the packages you need.\n\nI did my install over my home lan and the lan in work (which has DSL - running Linux as firewall/router/mailserver of course).\n\nBut yes you will need at least wvdial to make this puppy happen me thinks.\n\nIn fact it looks as if the base install comes with wvdial for just this kind of instal.\n\nBut I just found this on the Gentoo site for you.\nhttp://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=4691&highlight=modem\n\nSpecifically\n\nquote:\nIf it is not too obvious, these are the steps I took.\n\n\n    * Boot off the install CD\n    * modprobe serial\n    * setserial (if needed)\n    * create mount point for other distribution\n    * mount other distribution\n    * chroot'd to other distribution\n    * su - to regular user\n    * ran wvdial\n    * switch consoles and install as normal\n\n\nAnd yes I do give better technical support to people who use\ndistros I like.\n\nI'm only laughing on the outside \nMy smile is just skin deep \nIf you could see inside I'm really crying \nYou might join me for a weep.\n<<At your service Madame>>\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
