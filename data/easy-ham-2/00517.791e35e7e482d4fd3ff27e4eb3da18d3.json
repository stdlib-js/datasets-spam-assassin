Maybe its my lack of PHP \nbut why would a variable name _need_ to end with [] ?\n\nWith most languages you parse the submitted form data and should come out \nwith either variables or an array / hash, which you then work with and name \nwhatever you like.\n\n\nLee Hosty -x- hostyle AT csn.ul.ie -x- +353 (0)86 8768780\n--\nYONDER BOGINE (n.)\nThe kind of restaurant advertised as 'just three minutes from this cinema' \nwhich\nclearly nobody ever goes to and, even if they had ever contemplated it, have\ncertainly changed their mind since seeing the advert.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nWebdev mailing list\nWebdev@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/webdev\n\n"}
