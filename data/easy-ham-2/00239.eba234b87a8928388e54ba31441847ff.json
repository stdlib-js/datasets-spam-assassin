Thanks,\n\nHow about xcin?\nhttp://xcin.linux.org.tw/\n\nThis is an example of an XIM approach that Brian mentioned. hint shift-space \nget you back to typing in english.\n\nThe speed you can type at will be very dependent on how well you know the \ninput method and in some cases how well you know how to construct chinese \ncharacters.\n\nI have seen people using electronic pen and tablet devices to just write the \ncharacters in, though that was windows.\n\n~Al\n-- \nExpressed in this posting are my opinions.
