That's WAY\noutside the design spec for any such system.  Particularly when\nballistic intercept designs usually don't have any type of warhead\nassociated with them, either being kinetic or directed energy weapons.\n\nContrary to popular belief, ballistic missile defense isn't a hard\nproblem (ignoring whether or not it is useful).  The only real challenge\nis materials science, as it really pushes the envelope of materials\nperformance requirements to places they've never been; there has been\nsome technology crossover with some of the new materials and processes\nthey've had to come up with.  The actual discrimination algorithms,\nwhile way more advanced than anything you'll see in the private sector\n(and classified, to keep it that way), are usually run on a crusty old\nMIPS R3k embedded processor or similar, with a low-to-mid range DSP to\nhelp out. It is not computationally intensive by any means.\n\nI used to be tangentially involved in various ballistic missile\nintercept weapon programs many years ago and am pretty familiar with the\ntechnologies that go into them.  Most of the arguments against it from a\ntechnological standpoint are ignorant bullshit, and have lead me to\nbelieve that hardly anyone understands the technical parameters of\nballistic missile intercept.  And the arguments that are made without\nreference to the capability of the technology are neither particularly\nconvincing nor conclusive.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1) Ballistic missile intercept technology is useless on a big rock.  You\nare much better off using heavy-lift space technology to deliver a big\nnuke (or small nuke, depending on your plan). \n\n2) State-of-the-art ballistic missile intercept technology is far more\ncompetent than most people imagine it is, and has discrimination\ncapabilities that exceed most popular belief.  It better be -- they've\nhad twenty years to work on it.\n\n3) I've never heard a really convincing argument against deploying\nballistic missile intercept technology, particularly considering most of\nthe R&D investment has already been made. I don't really care about it\none way or the other, but I also don't see why other people have fits\nover it either.\n\nCheers,\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
