Many are not.\n\n\nIndeed - that I actually had understood prior\nto all this - for example commercial entities\nwith trial/limited/crippled editions. \n\nWhich is no problem - I don't see why that should\nbe a problem for SuSE though - surely the \nmore the merrrier as far as they're concerned.\n\n\n> Are you clear on this point, now?\n\n\nVide supra.\n\n\n> This is my second try. \n\n\nMighty white of you, old bean.\n\n\n>  One suspects that you actually understand\n>  perfectly, but just don't like it.\n\n\nOne can suspect what one likes. What I didn't \nunderstand was that SuSE had proprietary \nextensions that it wasn't prepared to allow\npeople to use under the GPL or even under  a\nFreeBSD style licence.\n\n\nI thought that the model for the likes of \nSuSE was selling support and customisation, \nrather than what I thought of as the core\n\"product\". I thought that the likes of Yast\ncame under core - maybe it worked in the glory\ndays before, say, 2001 - I can understand that\nthey might want to make more money, but the way\nin which they have done it, seems to me, to be \nbe against the spirit of the GPL.\n\n \n> You're further confused if you think the GNU \n> GPL gives you the right to get covered software\n> for free.  It does not.  \n\nAll I want is the OS and GNU apps. I was under\nthe impression that for *_those_* all one\nneeded was to pay for the media and not for the\ncode itself?\n\nAi-je tort?\n\n\n> It provides that _if_ you've lawfully received\n> a copy of the covered binary version, you have\n> rights to also receive the matching source code.\n\nMy understanding was that binaries or whatever\ncould be received for the cost of the media plus\na token of one's appreciation (the latter being\nsubject to agreement between the parties) - I was\noffering a bottle of wine plus maybe a pint or two\nand a chat for a copy - I don't know what the going\nrate is.\n\n\nIf I wanted support from SuSE, that would be a\ndifferent issue, and one for which I would be\nwilling to pay.\n \n\n> > I don't particularly need support, so I'm \n> > no really interested in purchasing a set of \n> > disks with 4 billion apps which I'll never use.\n\n\n> Then, if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set's\n> contents, the only way you can do that without\n> copyright violation _and_ without having to pay\n> the purchase price is to get someone to _give_ \n> (not \"lend\" or duplicate) you his copy.\n\n\nI have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll\nend up doing that!\n\nSeems to me to go against the spirit of\nthe GPL though.\n\n\n> > Yes, thanks for your input.

I can borrow them, but not \ncopy them? That's fine - IMHO, it goes against\nthe spirit of the GPL though.\n\n \n> Don't like SuSE's product licensing?

Why you \ncan't pass those on though, is beyond me.\n\n\nPaul...\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!? -- Une adresse @yahoo.fr gratuite et en fran�ais !\nYahoo!
