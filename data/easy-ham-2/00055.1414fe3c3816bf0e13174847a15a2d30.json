I sincerely appreciate\nIEEE's good faith effort to correct the mistake.\n\nConsequently, so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend\nthe screening, I want to give IEEE and SlugLUG permission to screen\nREVOLUTION OS at 1 PM on June 1.  I would ask the members of SVLUG to\nhold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am\ntrying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I\nwould prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print\nof the film.  If my distributor is unable to book the film into a\ntheater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to\nquickly set up a screening for its members.\n\nI realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I\noriginally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of\nREVOLUTION OS.  There are several reasons why I made the request, and\nnone of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk.  \n\nOne SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open\nSource movement would not be available for open viewings.  Another\nSlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter\nto Hobbyists.  \n\nThe bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement,\nbut to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open\nSourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch.  If I made a movie about\nthe history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a\nvegetarian.  \n\nI simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects\nworth exploring and documenting.  As a result, I came to admire many\naspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary\non the movement's positive history.  However, I do not think I should be\npunished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by\nhaving my intellectual property misappropriated.   More practically, my\nfeelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you\nsee the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits.  \n\nI realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing\nis considered fair use.  I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine. \nHowever, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at\nhome with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a\nuniversity campus.  So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized\nscreenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter.  Personally, I\nbelieve that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should\nretain the choice to Open Source their IP.  If the Open Source movement\nis not voluntary then it is really just piracy.\n\nOne of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of\nthe film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin\nselling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a\nlicense permitting noncommercial large group screenings.  We hope to use\nthe money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the\nDVD.  I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford\nto take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt.  Thus the importance of\npreserving the educational/institutional market.\n\nFrequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists\nthat justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the\nartists and only hurts the greedy record labels.  Well, in the case of\nREVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish. \nIt's just me.  I made and financed the film on my own.  I have worked\nfull-time for almost three years without a salary.  The only way I will\nget out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek\nout legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS.\n\nI truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for\nREVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.  If you\nwill just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested\npersons to legally view it.\n\nI hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening\nat UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJ.T.S.
