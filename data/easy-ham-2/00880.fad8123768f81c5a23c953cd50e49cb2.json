Considering the Genesis project just won an award for\nfiguring out (surprise, surprise) that N-body problems with 10+ bodies\nyield some interesting synergetic surprises ...  suffice it to say\nthat the issue has been hashed over in sci.astro many, many times,\nsince even long before Hollywood posed the problem, and the very best\nadvice is still \"duck and cover\"; if you are still going to nudge\nanything, though, I'd nudge the rock (the one the size of a small\ntown) as you're less likely to re-define global agriculture that way.\n\n'Course, you're gonna have this problem of distributing the force over\na large enough surface area that it translates into a resillient\ncompression wave instead of a knifeblade/diamond faultline split.\nIt's also not a game of billiards, but a 6+ dimensional collision\nproblem (space, time, spin, temp, maybe electromag too if there's any\nheavy metals in it, and there often is) complete with relativistic\neffects and everything. Hands up all those with experience subjecting\nblackboxed alien geology to sustained forces in excess of 100 megatons\n(10% of it's own momentum).  I'm going to trust the US Army with this\nwhen they can't even /find/ more than a few hundred Al Queda in a\ndesert? \n\nOh, another problem: It's not the only rock out there.  We're just\ngetting better at spotting them.\n\nTell ya what: when you cowboys do get ready to bally-hootin' out to\nblow-er-up-real-good, you let me know, eh, so I can move the the next\nsolar system before you do.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\nBusiness Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com\n\"Computers are useless.
