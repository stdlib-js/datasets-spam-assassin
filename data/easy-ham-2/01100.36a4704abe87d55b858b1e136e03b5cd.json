Earlier this year, the RIAA announced its new plan\nto access computers without owner's consent for the sake of protecting its\nassets. Information Wave believes this policy puts its customers at risk of\nunintentional damage, corporate espionage, and invasion of privacy to say\nthe least.\n\nDue to the nature of this matter and RIAA's previous history, we feel the\nRIAA will abuse software vulnerabilities in a client's browser after the\nbrowser accesses its site, potentially allowing the RIAA to access and/or\ntamper with your data. Starting at midnight on August 19, 2002, Information\nWave customers will no longer be able to reach the RIAA's web site.\nInformation Wave will also actively seek out attempts by the RIAA to thwart\nthis policy and apply additional filters to protect our customers' data.\n\nInformation Wave will also deploy peer-to-peer clients on the Gnutella\nnetwork from its security research and development network (honeynet) which\nwill offer files with popular song titles derived from the Billboard Top\n100 maintained by VNU eMedia. No copyright violations will take place,\nthese files will merely have arbitrary sizes similar to the length of a 3\nto 4 minute MP3 audio file encoded at 128kbps. Clients which connect to our\npeer-to-peer clients, and then afterwards attempt to illegally access the\nnetwork will be immediately blacklisted from Information Wave's network.\nThe data collected will be actively maintained and distributed from our\nnetwork operations site.\n\nThe placement of this policy is not intended to hamper the RIAA's piracy\nelimination agenda or advocate Internet piracy, but to ensure the safety of\nour customers' data attached to our network from hackers or corporate\nespionage hidden by the veil of RIAA copyright enforcement.\n\nIf you have questions, comments, or concerns regarding this policy, please\ne-mail riaa@informationwave.net.\n\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.
