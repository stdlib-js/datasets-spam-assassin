But RealNetworks\nacknowledged that it was possible that the company might incur\nMicrosoft's legal wrath.\n\nNevertheless, Rob Glaser, a former Microsoft executive who founded\nRealNetworks as Progressive Networks in 1994, said he believed the\nstrategy was good for both Microsoft and consumers.\n\n\"A rational way for them to respond would be to say, `This is great,' \"\nhe said. \"That would be Microsoft of the future.\"\n\nMr. Glaser said his company, based in Seattle, had developed a version\nof the Microsoft Media Server software that comes with the Windows\noperating system.\n\nHe said RealNetworks' engineers had studied the data that was sent\nbetween the Microsoft media server software and the Windows Media Player\nprogram and recreated the technology needed to play files in the\nMicrosoft format. This method created a so-called clean-room version,\nmeaning the developers built the transmission software without any\nknowledge about the underlying program.\n\nMicrosoft has adopted a similar strategy at several junctures,\nMr. Glaser said, reverse-engineering technologies like NetWare,\nPostScript and JavaScript at different times.\n\nMicrosoft executives said the company currently licensed the Windows\nMedia Player technology to a variety of companies including Yahoo,\nRealNetworks and the America Online unit of AOL Time Warner. But a\nMicrosoft executive said that a clean-room copy of the Windows server\ntechnology could lead to quality and performance issues.\n\n\"It's kind of hard to speculate about the technology until we see it,\"\nsaid Dave Fester, the general manager of the Windows Media division. If\na company has not licensed the server software, he added, \"we would need\nto look at it and see what they're doing.\"\n\nRealNetworks appears to be endeavoring to avoid being \"Netscaped,\" a\nreference to the fate that befell the Netscape Communications\nCorporation when Microsoft decided to make an Internet browser, which\nwas pioneered commercially by Netscape, a standard part of the Windows\noperating system. Netscape was later acquired by AOL Time\nWarner. Microsoft's decision to build an Internet browser into Windows\nand give it away at no additional cost led directly to a bitter\nantitrust lawsuit brought by the Justice Department in 1997.\n\nRealNetworks, which was a pioneer in the market for streaming media to\ndesktop personal computers, has been under growing pressure from\nMicrosoft, which is giving away both the server and Windows Media Player\nprogram as part of its operating strategy. RealNetworks also faces\nchallenges from Apple Computer, which offers the QuickTime media player\nas a part of its Macintosh OS X operating system and sells a more\nfull-featured player.\n\nMoreover, in recent months Macromedia Inc., which makes the Flash\nanimation software used on many Web sites, has added video capabilities\nto its technology, making it a potential rival.\n\nRealNetworks is gambling that with a proliferation of different\nstandards and formats for video and audio, the media corporations that\nmake content available over the Internet will flock to a single system\nthat supports multiple types of data. The company is trying to shift the\nfocus of the competition from the PC desktop to the server, according to\nanalysts.\n\nSeveral analysts said the RealNetworks shift in strategy could put\nMicrosoft on the defensive.\n\n\"Real has got the experience and sophistication to pull this off,\" said\nRichard Doherty, the president of Envisioneering, a market research and\nconsulting firm based in Seaford, N.Y. \"It will open up a new horse race.\"\n\nUntil now the companies have been engaged in a technology war to rapidly\nincrease the power and quality of each of their media players. At the\nsame time, they have competed over which of the programs are placed on\nthe desktops of personal computer users. RealNetworks claims to have\n700,000 subscribers for pay services, but it is perceived as being\nincreasingly vulnerable, according to some analysts, because Microsoft\nhas included its Media Player as part of the Windows operating system,\nwhich dominates the PC market.\n\nThere are dozens of data formats for playing audio and video on the\nInternet, but the dominant ones are RealAudio and RealVideo from\nRealNetworks, QuickTime from Apple, Windows Media from Microsoft and the\nindustry digital movie standards MPEG-2 and MPEG-4.\n\nMicrosoft and RealNetworks are currently locked in a close race for\ndesktop media player leadership. In the first quarter of this year,\naccording to survey data collected by Jupiter Research, a market\nresearch firm based in New York, RealNetworks' RealOne Player had a 29.1\npercent share of media players, while Microsoft's Windows Media Player\nhad a 28.2 percent share. Apple's Quicktime player was third, with a\n12.2 percent.\n\nThe new server software from RealNetworks is part of a version of the\ncompany's media server that is to be introduced on Monday and which will\nbe called the Helix Universal Server. RealNetworks said it would offer\nperformance data based on a test it financed at an independent testing\nservice, KeyLabs, that indicate that the Helix software can, under some\nconditions, deliver up to four times the speed of the Windows Media\nServer in Microsoft's operating system. (Software servers are programs\nthat run on powerful computers and can send streams of digital\ninformation to many computer users simultaneously.)\n\nAt a news conference scheduled to be held in San Francisco, RealNetworks\nis also expected to announce that it plans to make the Helix software\navailable as part of a strategy known as community source, which will\nmake it possible for RealNetworks partners and competitors to take\nadvantage of the original programmers' instructions.\n\nRealNetworks is to announce a range of partners, including Hitachi,\nHewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Deutsche Telekom, NEC, Nokia, Cisco Systems,\nOracle, Sun Microsystems, Palm, Texas Instruments and others. These\npartners could then incorporate the software into their own hardware and\nsoftware products.\n\nUnder the licensing strategy, companies will be able to freely gain\naccess to the underlying code that the Helix program is based on, but\nthey will still pay a licensing fee when they sell commercial products\nbased on the technology.\n\nThe community-source approach to software, which was pioneered by Sun to\ndistribute its Java programming language, is a variation upon the\noriginal free software or open-source approach which has confounded the\nsoftware industry in recent years.\n\nWhile open-source software can be freely shared, with some restrictions,\nthe community-source approach is more restrictive and yet still tries to\npersuade others to collaborate and add innovative ideas.\n\nOther large technology companies including Sun, I.B.M. and Apple, have\nall now adopted variations on such open-source strategy, with varying\nresults. In Sun's case, the company has been criticized because, while\nJava has become an industry standard, the company has not been the\nprincipal financial beneficiary in many cases.\n\nRealNetworks is trying to strike a balance between opening up its\ntechnology to persuade others to participate and innovate and not losing\ncontrol of the technology entirely, Mr. Glaser said. \"We think we've\nstruck the balance well,\" he said.\n\nAnalysts said the strategy shift by RealNetworks was likely to shake up\nthe industry. \"The moment you've open-sourced something you've cornered\nyour competitor,\" said Matthew Berk, an analyst a Jupiter Research. \"To\ndate this stuff has been very proprietary. Opening it up makes it\naccessible to creative and gifted programmers who will come up with wild\nstuff that the companies have never considered.\"\n\nMr. Glaser said he expected other companies to produce technology that\nwould rival RealNetworks' commercially as a result of the\ncommunity-source strategy.\n\nOne possibility is that companies such as Sun or I.B.M. could decide to\nadd the Helix technology of RealNetworks as a standard component of\ntheir operating systems. Although RealNetworks might not get a\nsignificant financial benefit from such an arrangement it could\ncontribute to making its Helix software a de facto industry standard.\n\nMr. Glaser said he had struck upon the idea of making his media server\nsoftware open source while visiting with an executive from Nokia, the\nworld's largest cellphone maker.\n\n\"Taking all of this stuff beyond the PC has been a huge motivation for\nus,\" he said. When he realized that Nokia was interested in deploying\nthe software technology on as many as 30 to 40 different types of\nphones, he realized that RealNetworks did not have enough programming\ntalent to support the effort.\n\n\"I told him, `I don't think we have enough engineers even if you guys\nwere willing to pay us,' \" he said.\n\nThat touched off a search for an alternative way of having the two\ncompanies cooperate.\n\n\n\nhttp://quicken.com.com/2100-1023-945406.html\n\nReal takes the open-source route \nBy Jim Hu \nStaff Writer, CNET News.com\nJuly 22, 2002, 1:55 PM PT\n\nRealNetworks on Monday unveiled a new open-source version of its\nstreaming media technology that supports multiple file formats for audio\nand video, including those that use Microsoft's Windows Media technology. \n\nThe new campaign, dubbed \"Helix,\" and first reported by The New York\nTimes, marks one of the most ambitious moves in the company's\nhistory. RealNetworks is simultaneously releasing technology without\npermission that plugs in to Microsoft's competing software and is\nraising the hood on much of its own software technology to \"open source\"\ndevelopers or anyone else who wants to look. \n\nThe twin moves raise the risk of lawsuits and renewed competition --\npotentially even from Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft itself, once it\ngets a look under the hood at RealNetworks' technology. But it marks a\ndramatic, potential way for a company watching its market share diminish\nto regain momentum and support across an industry where many other\nplayers remain skeptical of Microsoft's power.\n\n\"It's a very bold move on the part of Real,\" said Michael Gartenberg, a\nresearch director for analyst firm Jupiter Research. \"This was a shot\nfired by Real and fired directly at Redmond.\" \n\nThe move is the latest in a series of strategic twists and turns that\nhas made RealNetworks one of the only companies to survive direct\nMicrosoft competition for years. While the company has expanded into\npaid subscription content business, its software and streaming media\ninfrastructures have been under increasing pressure from Microsoft,\nwhich has deemed multimedia to be one of the major drives under the\nlatest versions of its Windows operating system. \n\nReal's Helix announcement mainly involves the technology that allows\nmedia files to move from place to place over the Internet. RealNetworks\nand Microsoft both produce servers that allow video and audio to be\nstreamed from a content company such as CNN or NBC to a personal\ncomputer. Real has charged for this software, while Microsoft has given\nit away for free. \n\nIn April, RealMedia reached 17 million at-home viewers, compared with\nWindows Media at 15.1 million and Apple Computer's QuickTime at 7.3\nmillion, according to Nielsen/NetRatings. At work, Windows Media drew\nabout 12.2 million unique viewers, compared with RealMedia's 11.6\nmillion and QuickTime's 5 million. \n\nReal's own new product, called the Universal Server, will allow one\nserver to stream Real's technology, Microsoft files, Apple Computer's\nQuickTime, and others. Most other competing products do not support\ncompetitors' technology. \n\n\"When you have all these different platforms, and all these different\nprotocols, it gets unmanageable,\" RealNetworks' Rob Glaser said at a\nhigh-glitz press conference in San Francisco announcing the product. \"A\nlot of what (this technology) is about is breaking those bottlenecks and\nmaking convergence really converge.\" \n\nTo make the new product compatible with Microsoft files, however, the\ncompany pursued a risky strategy known as \"reverse engineering,\" in\nwhich developers examine a competitor's product to see how it works and\ntry to create something that works just like it. \n\nGlaser said that engineers worked entirely in a \"clean room\"\nenvironment, meaning that they had no access to actual Microsoft\ncode. Had they simply copied code, they could be liable for patent\ninfringement. The resulting product simply mimics the way that\nMicrosoft's files are sent across networks and allows a Windows Media\nplayer to receive the file. \n\nOther companies have been sued for simply copying a competitor's code\nand putting it in their own products. But RealNetworks says it's not\nworried about Microsoft lawsuits, because it took precautions to do all\ndevelopment in the \"clean room\" environment. Microsoft itself has\nengaged in this kind of legal reverse engineering. \n\nAnalysts say Microsoft, which still faces antitrust lawsuits, is in no\nposition to sue in any case. \n\n\"This is a very tenuous time for Microsoft,\" Gartenberg said. \"This is\nnot a time in Microsoft's history when it can be seen as trying to do to\nReal what it did to Netscape.\" \n\nThe influential giant?\n\nCertainly, Monday's announcement acknowledges Microsoft's influence in\nmedia technology, something Glaser and Real have often been loathe to do. \n\nMicrosoft was quick to spin Monday's announcement as further validation\nof its strength in the marketplace. \n\n\"It's an admission of RealNetworks that it's important for them to\nsupport Windows Media and that we're now the leading player among home\nand work users,\" said Michael Aldridge, lead product manager for\nMicrosoft's Windows Digital Media division. \n\nAldridge added that RealNetworks currently has a licensing agreement for\nits media player to support Windows audio and video formats. However,\nRealNetworks and Microsoft do not have an agreement to allow the server\nto deliver Windows Media formats to end users, which is what\nRealNetworks trying to do. \n\nAldridge declined to comment on RealNetworks' replication of Microsoft's\ntechnology. \n\nIn addition to its own new product, Real has promised to give away\nsource code to much of the underlying technology for streaming\nmedia. That stops short of the actual file format, or \"codec\" itself,\nbut will provide the open-source community and other companies with\npowerful new tools to build their own streaming media players or\nsoftware. \n\nGlaser said he wouldn't initially make the software code that mimics\nMicrosoft's streaming available but that he was considering the idea. A\nfirst chunk of code underlying the RealNetworks multimedia player\nsoftware will be released in 90 days. Other code, including the basic\nfunctions of its streaming media server and encoder, will be released by\nthe end of the year, the company said. \n\nThe company's plan to reveal its source code--the basic instructions\nunderlying the software--echoes similar moves made by Netscape\nCommunications to defend against Microsoft. In March 1998, Netscape took\nthe bold step of opening its source code to allow software developers to\nhelp create the next generation of its popular browser. \n\nJames Barksdale, then CEO of Netscape, said the move would allow the\ncompany to \"tap into a virtually unlimited developer talent pool.\"\nInstead, the effort, which has evolved into the Mozilla.org project, hit\nconsiderable roadblocks, and Microsoft overtook Netscape in market\nshare. \n\n\n\n----\naDaM@XeNT.CoM -- .sig double play!\n\n\nWe have done a great job of having teams work around the clock to\ndeliver security fixes for any problems that arise.

It is simply a waste of time for folks to say that \"HTTP\nallows this because I've seen it used by this common CGI script.\"  If we\nthought that sucky CGI scripts were the basis for good Web\narchitectures, then we wouldn't have needed a Gateway Interface to\nimplement them.  In order for SOAP-ng to succeed as a Web protocol, it\nneeds to start behaving like it is part of the Web.  That means, among\nother things, that it should stop trying to encapsulate all sorts of\nactions under an object-specific interface.  It needs to limit its\nobject-specific behavior to those situations in which object-specific\nbehavior is actually desirable.  If it does not do so, then it is not\nusing URI as the basis for resource identification, and therefore it is\nno more part of the Web than SMTP.\n  -- Roy Fielding, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Apr/0181.html\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
