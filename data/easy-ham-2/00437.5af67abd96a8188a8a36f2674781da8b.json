You could\nalso get some pcmcia to pci adapters or wireless pci network cards for\nyour desktop machines.\n\nThe access point would be configured with a network name (essid) and a\nchannel number for you wireless network.  The client machine would be\nconfigured with the same network name, it should be able to auto detect\nthe channel number.\n\nDriver support is very good, there are only a few wireless chipsets,\nand I believe that all but the newest 802.11b Plus (22Mbps) and 802.11a\nhardware has Linux drivers.\n\nIf you need anymore help or info checkout the forums and irc channel at\n<URL:http://www.irishwan.org/>.\n\nRobert Fitzsimons\nrobfitz@273k.net\n\nOn Fri, Aug 16, 2002 at 05:39:21PM +0100, Justin MacCarthy wrote:\n> I have a small network at home,\n> \n> Connected by 5 port hub....\n> \"smoothwall\" smoothwall server  \t192.168.1.1\n> \"shaftoe\" \tWindows 2000\t\t192.168.1.75\n> \"gotodengo\"\tLinux\t\t\t\t192.168.1.50\n> \n> \n> The family has a new pc I want to plug in, to use the ISDN in smoothwall.\n> I also have a notebook.\n> \n> \n> I want to plug both of these into the network using a wireless connection.\n> What's the best way to do this???
