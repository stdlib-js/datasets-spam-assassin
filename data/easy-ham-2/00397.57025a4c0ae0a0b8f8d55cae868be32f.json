These I've\nused for about eight years, and I'm not about to change them now.\n\n Stuff like alt-1 to go to workspace-1, I love - it just appeared in\nwindowmaker about six years back, and I've also gotten used to it.\n\n> As to the sawfish issue, no idea, sorry - are you sure that\n> gnome2's panel handles 1.4 applets at all?\n\n Wierdly, I've gone back to sawfish & gnome 1.4 - and the keybindings\nstill don't work. It's not fair.\n\nKate\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
