The CAMPAIGN\n         FOR DIGITAL RIGHTS published its first in-depth analysis of\n         the EUCD. For this exciting installment, CD-R has\n         concentrated on what it does to people who have to\n         circumvent copy protection to do their job. The short\n         summary is: if they're not a teacher, a prison warder,\n         disabled, or the cops, they can forget their jobs. If you're\n         anyone else - like a musician, or a cryptographer -  and the\n         copy protection says you can't make a backup, you can't. And\n         even if you *are* a teacher or other exceptional person,\n         you'll have to ask the Secretary of State if you can crack\n         the protected CD. In writing. Each time.\n         http://uk.eurorights.org/issues/eucd/ukimpl/\n                                     - oh, don't worry, it gets worse\n         http://www.stand.org.uk/weblog/archive/2002/08/21/000243.php\n                                   - what you can do to stop all this\n\n         But there's plenty more to ooze out of the law than that.\n         One of the big questions about the EUCD is \"is it the\n         European DMCA, or what?\". Well, the DMCA spurted bad juice\n         in many different directions, but one way in which the two\n         are similiar is over \"circumvention devices\". Distributing\n         DeCSS, the DVD lobby have claimed, is a crime under the\n         DMCA. DeCSS is code that was also a magically dangerous\n         artifact: a circumvention device. Circumvention devices are\n         about to become illegal here. Specifically, three months in\n         chokey (or two years if you really nark the judge), for\n         those who \"distribute otherwise than in the course of a\n         business to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the\n         copyright owner\" one of them. \"Otherwise in the course of\n         business\" is legalese for \"as an ordinary punter\", so it's\n         not just mod-chip sellers who are liable. Anyone who\n         distributes such satanic machines is also a perp.\n         http://www.stand.org.uk/weblog/archive/2002/08/21/000243.php\n                                   - what you can do to stop all this\n\n         That's not going to go down well with ANDREW SIMMONS.\n         Regular NTK readers will remember Andrew as a lightning rod\n         to lawyers. Not only was he John Doe #13 in the American\n         DeCSS case, but in a completely unrelated affair, he waws\n         threatened with all manner of nastiness just for publishing\n         his list of doomed dotcoms on his Website [NTK 2000-09-22].\n         In the last week, he's had another letter via Demon, finally\n         ordering him to remove his shiny \"circumvention device\" (aka\n         DeCSS) from his site. It sounds like the lawyers may have\n         shot their wad a tad early: the EUCD rules don't kick in\n         until Christmas. But when the new laws do hit, and if what\n         Andrew's preposterous correspondent says is believed in a UK\n         court, hosting DeCSS *will* mean jail. There's been some\n         talk about how the EUCD rules are better than the DMCA,\n         because they specifically exclude computer programs from the\n         new rules. Well, it looks like DeCSS is no longer just a\n         computer program.
