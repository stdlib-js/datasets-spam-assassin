What you're saying is \nthat \"most rich people are smart\" and that the latter is causal to \nthe former.  By implication, then, you would say that \"most poor \npeople are stupid\".  This is true, statistically, because most \npeople are poor and most people are also stupid.  However there's \nnothing to indicate a causal link there.  So being smart isn't the \nonly mechanical requirement to eternal wealth because, obviously, \nmost of the members of this list would be rich.\n\nBeing smart, for example, has made Stephen Hawking famous and \nrespected, but he's not particularly rich.  Jennifer Lopez is by \nall accounts a complete moron.  In fact, spend a weekend in Beverly \nHills and you will encounter vast numbers of people who are \nprofoundly stupid driving Rolls Royces and shopping at PRADA.\n\nThe working class IS the market and the working class IS where \nwealth is created.  The working class makes long-distance calls, \nbuys food processors and computers and clothes, and attaches the \nvalue to goods which allows them to be commodified.  The working \nclass saves money, buys Retirement Savings Plans, and invests in \nmutual funds which increases the flow of capital through the \ninvestment funnel.\n\nThe economic system of the first world is designed to strike a \ndelicate balance between incentivizing the ruling class to support \nwealth-expanding through technological innovation or the \ndevelopment of new markets.  At the 100,000 foot level, recessions \nand depressions are created when more wealth is sucked from the \nwhirlpool than can be supported by the working class through \ninvestment and consumption.\n\nAnd the people draining the hot tub are the folks in the ruling \nclass -- people like Ken Lay, Dick Cheney, Bernie Ebbers, et al -- \nand they simply got too greedy and caused a bubble in the \nhydraulics that increased the pressure for a time, but ultimately \nwasn't sustainable.\n\nAnd the money that was lost did not come from the ruling class.  It \ncame from the RSP's and the Equity funds and the Investments of \nindividual working class -- people who believed these reports and \ninvested.  The wealth of the ruling class was largely pulled out by \nthe time such investments were exposed to the workers.\n\nSo, is the lower caste necessarily stupid for saving money or \ninvesting in retirement plans?  I don't think so.  Are they stupid \nfor buying clothes and automobiles?  I don't think so.\n\nAt the granular level, the notion that \"most rich people are rich \nbecause they're smart\" is so anecdotal and naive that it's not \nworth arguing about, so I won't.  Still, a compelling point worth \nsome clarification.\n\n-Ian.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
