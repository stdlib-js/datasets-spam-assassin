Elegant.\n\n==\n\nhttp://technoerotica.net/mylog/hostfile.html\n\nAs mentioned throughout this site, there is more than one way to skin a cat\nwhen it comes to pop-ups. The hosts file is one of the most effective\nmethods there is. In brief, a hosts file is a text file used by Windows to\nresolve domain names and IP addresses. If you're running windows, you\nalready have a hosts file but it most likely isn't being used.\n\nWhat a hosts file does is simple, it lists domains and IP numbers. To get\nrid of ads, the hosts file lists the domain names of adservers along with\nthe IP number 127.0.0.1. This tells windows to grab any content from the\nlisted domain from the specified IP number. The specified IP number in this\ncase is your own computer. What happens is that it won't display the ad. If\nyou choose this method of ad removal there is no need to use our opt out\nlinks. The hosts file is a very effective mechanism.\n\nYou can download this hosts file, unzip it and place it in your Windows\ndirectory. YOU SHOULD MAKE A BACK UP of your existing hosts file before you\ndo. The hosts file is called \"hosts\" there is no extension. You may have a\nfile named Hosts.sam this is merely a sample hosts file.\n\nOnce you download the file and put it in the windows folder, reboot your\ncomputer and it's a done deal. Pretty simple huh? You might want to look at\nthe contents of this file as it contains additional information as well as\nan address for getting updated versions. <http://www.accs-net.com/hosts/>\n\nBecause we're inherently lazy, this works for windows only, don't use it on\na mac! Follow the address in the hosts file for alternative system\ninstructions.\ndownload now <http://technoerotica.net/mylog/hosts.zip>\n\n\nWe didn't write this file and do not provide support for it's use. Follow\nthe address in the hosts file for questions. It's not that we don't want to\nhear from you but the folks at this address have the answers you need.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
