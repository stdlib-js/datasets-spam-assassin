But it's my principle \nas a sometime working journalist  not to get all carried \naway whenever I witness something like that.  They might \nwell be drinking their own bathwater.  This sort of thing \ngenerally requires a reality check from some *other* \nconference. \n\n   So, I'm now fresh back from Colorado, from the yearly \nmeeting of the High Ground Design Conversation.  These are \nmy best pals in the industrial design world, some dear, \nlong-time friends of mine, whose judgment I always trust.  \nAnd why would a science fiction writer trust the judgment \nof industrial designers?  Well, because they're very \n*trendy.*  They're very shrewd,  and very stylish, and very \nhands-on people.  They're  peculiarly self-effacing and modest,\nyet quite  imaginative.  Better yet, they're even practical.  \nSo they're kind of like science fiction writers, only with \nmuch better shoes.\n\n    Usually when I go to this High Ground event, I just \ndeliver some wacko chat about popular aspects of \ncyberculture and then I take some worshipful notes.  But!  \nI have to report that when I took them my notes from the \n\"CRA Grand Challenges in Computation\" conference, I was \nbringing the noise.\n\n    This is the first time I have ever seen their jaws \ndrop.  They're still kinda wringing their hands over the \ndotcom boom and the Ka-boom. They miss those glory days of \nthe World Wide Web == because for them, that was the \nGraphic Designers Full Employment Act.  So they're pretty \nbroke, and they're a little shell-shocked, so I guess they \nshould join the club.  But  when I brought them *this* \nstuff == a rather extensively worked-out vision in \nworldbuilding from the point of view of ubiquitous \ncomputation in the 21st century...  Well, of course this \nis merely a scenario, but to me, \"911.net\" smells like the \nfuture.\n\n     And frankly, it doesn't smell good.  But that's all \nright.  Because these aren't good times.  These are rather \nharsh, dark times, and in its own peculiar way, 911.net is \na similarly harsh, dark concept.\n\n    \"Ubiquitous computation\" is by no means a new idea.   \nThe guy who invented the term is dead, and even his R&D \nlab doesn't look all that great these days.  Ubicomp has \nbeen around for quite some time == in the table-napkin, \nhandwaving stage.  But it's lacked the means, motive and \nopportunity to get any real-world traction.\n\n   I believe that may be changing.  If so, it's mostly due \nto the events of September 11.  After that experience, \nubicomp has got motive and opportunity as it never had \nbefore.  And the means, although they are still \nspeculative, are starting to make some sense.\n\n    What am I talking about when I use the term \"ubicomp\"?  \nWell, the term is a grab-bag, a congelation of different \ntechnologies.  Some are here, commercially available off \nthe shelf; some are in the lab; and some may be physically \nimpossible.\n\n    Let's get down to some brass virtual tacks.  What are \nthe key technical drivers for widely distributed, self-\norganizing networks of sensors, processors and actuators, \nembedded in the physical world?  And what do you do with \nthese things?\n\n    Okay, number one:  fuel cells.  Not chemical \nbatteries.  Small, portable, dependable, long-lasting, \npower sources with some punch.  They may not be fuel cells \nas they are now known.  They might be MEMS fuel cells, or \naluminum-air cells, or something enzymatic, I don't care; \njust something much, much better than today's batteries.  \nPortable power is the crux.  Ubicomp's  future, if it has one,\nentirely hinges on this.  If we don't get some seriously \nadvanced,  portable sources of power then everything I am \nabout to tell you is a sci-fi phantasm. (Not that there's \nanything wrong with that!)\n\n    Number two, RFID.  Radio-Frequency ID == gotta have \nsome taggers.  Gotta be on the Net.  It'd be nice if they \nhad some powered processors in them.  Something internal, \npervasive, a little computational action that is going on \ninside physical objects.\n\n    Number three, wireless broadband.  Getting real close \nhere.\n\n   Number four, dongles.  I think this part is seriously \nunderappreciated.  This is the weird part of ubicomp, the \npart that may turn out to be its Achilles heel:  some way \nto turn the damn thing off.  And to *know* it's off.  The \nproblem of the authorized user.  The authorized \nadministrator, the authorized access.  This is likely to \nplay out as ubicomp's functional equivalent of the \nInternet's intellectual-property problem.  In other words, \nit's a very serious issue which is going to be neglected \nfrom the get-go, as people are eagerly building the basic \ninfrastructure.  Then, as they lamely try to build it in \nlater, they are going to find out that they have \ninadvertently poisoned the water-stream for everybody.\n\n    You don't want to wander into a Kazaa and Napster \nversion of George Orwell.  Ubiquitous computation, unlike \ninformation, does not \"want to be free.\"  This is not a \ntechnology of freedom. Ubiquitous computation wants to \nmake you its slave. Try to remember that, for all our \nsakes, all right?  This is not a water-cooler for gossip, \nlike the Internet is.  This is a hard-case, hard-times, \nhands-on, rather ruthless command-and-control system.\n\n    Number five, GPS, global positioning systems.  Been \nthere, done that.\n\n    Number six, convoy traffic.  I think this is also \nunderestimated, for when I started looking at serious \napplications for ubicomp, time and again, rapidly shipping \nlarge amounts of physical material in and out of the \nubicomp zone is a killer application.  Getting stuff in, \nnumbering it, assembling it, moving it out. Lots of it. \nTrain loads, truck loads, bus loads. And airlifts.\n\n    Bringing up the van, a whole bunch of other ubi-stuff, \nof varying degrees of use and practicality.  High speed \nfiber optic networks, check.  Massive storage and routers, \ncheck.  Big databases, check, but they need to be fast and \nflexible. Some \"MobiHoc\" action: mobile ad-hoc self-\nassembling networks: networks that are always \nreconfiguring in real-time, always on the move.  \n\n    Facial recognition has a considerable number of \nubicomp applications, by no means all of them good.  Human \npresence-sensing systems?  Oh yes.  Ruggedized hardware \nsuitable for outdoor deployment in all conditions and \nweathers.  Real-time simulation of ongoing major \nsituations.  Toxin detectors of various kinds, \nenvironmental monitoring of almost every sort, biometric \nID...  I have a long list of these.  I'm cross-checking \nthem.  I'm using them to build scenarios.\n\n    One thing about 911.net makes it very distinct from \nearlier visions of ubicomp.  This is not Microsoft Windows \nfor Housekeeping.  This is a hard, tough web that you \nthrow down fast over dire emergencies.  The key concept \nhere is that we are finally moving computation out of the \nivory tower, for good and all.  No more glass boxes of the \n1950s, no more clean abstractions of cyberspace.  We are \ndeploying computation at unheard-of speed, into the \ndarkest, dirtiest, most dangerous places in the world.\n\n    It is a resilient security apparatus for emergencies. \nThat is 911.net.  \n\n    Now, you might well argue that ubicomp is very \ninvasive of privacy.  That's just what my industrial \ndesign pals said about it, immediately, and they were \nright.  It's been hard to find reasonable deployments for \nubicomp in peacetime commerce and in private homes, \nbecause it is so Orwellian. However.  Under certain \ncircumstances, other social circumstances do trump this \nissue.\n\n    For instance, when you are breathing your last under a \npile of earthquake rubble, you don't really care much \nabout privacy under your circumstances.  What you really \nwant is  a smart bulldozer, a tourniquet, and some direct \npressure against your open wounds.  And that is what \n911.net is about == or will be about, should it find its \nway out of the computer-science talking-shop and into \ndaylight.  \n\n     It is an emergency response system for the planet's \nopen wounds.  And those wounds exist in plenty.  There are \nmore of them all the time.\n\n    I rather doubt that the Orwellian version of ubicomp \nhas much of a future.  That's a scenario that I have \ndubbed \"Terrorspace\", which is ubicomp in the context of \nairports and nuclear power sites.  If you've been in \nairports recently, I believe you are seeing a pretty apt, \nearly version of Terrorspace.  At any random moment, you \ncan have your possessions rifled through by strangers.  \nYour shoes are scanned, and various small but vital \nobjects in your pockets can be confiscated by semi-\neducated security geeks.  They're either pathetically \nunder-trained for the job (in which case you certainly \nfeel no safer), or else they are intelligent and capable \npeople (in which case you pity them and wish they had some \nother job, for the sake of general human happiness and the \nGNP).  Rather than making us any safer, Terrorspace \nairports serve as political indoctrination centers that \nhumiliate our voting population on a broad scale. They are \nmeant to inure us to ever-escalating levels of \ngovernmental clumsiness and general harm.\n\n    The difficulty with this Terrorspace approach is that \nairports and airlines are going broke.  Airports are \nhemorrhaging money trying to maintain this terrorspace \napparatus.  It is likely to spread to the brittle power of \nnuclear power plants, nuclear waste dumps, bio-sites, \nchemical sites, liquid petroleum gas centers and so forth. \nThat will hugely increase the overhead of all these \ndangerous industries. \n\n    That's a very considerable tax burden.  So, though \nTerrorspace may serve as a full employment program for the \nloyal and slightly stupid, that's not going to pay off \nsocially or economically in the long run.\n\n   However, 911.net is a different matter.   An air-\ndeployable 911.net that allowed first responders to \nrapidly deal with fires, floods and other major disasters \nwould *save* money, especially for the insurers, who are \nalready on the ropes.\n\n    The actual September 11 event, 9/11, was a rare and \nremarkable thing.  And, with fewer than 3,000 people dead, \nit's just not that big a deal as genuine catastrophes go.  \nPolitically, theologically and militarily it was huge, but \na workaday 911.net wouldn't fret much about terrorism.  \nInstead, it would have to deal mostly with floods, fires, \nclimate change, earthquakes, volcanoes and (let's hope \nnever) asteroids and weapons of mass destruction.\n\n   So, basically, with 911.net, we are describing a social \nre-definition of computer geeks as firemen.  Native \ntwenty-first century computer geeks as muscular, with-it, \nfirst-responder types.  I think this would be pretty good \nfor the computer industry.  We all need to take the \ndysfunctional physical world far more seriously.  This \nweek, Italy's flooding, Texas is flooding, Colorado's on \nfire.  This morning, the brand-new wilderness forests \naround the site of the former Chernobyl are on fire, \nspewing radioactive ash hither and yon.   Chunks of \nAntarctica the size of Rhode Island have fallen into the \nsea. I could go on.\n\n    This is the sort of activity that humanity is required \nto deal with in this new century. If we build a successful \nmethod with which to do this, those useful tactics will \nspread across the fabric of our civilization.  I believe \nthey are already spreading.  An innovation like 911.net \nwill likely serve as a camel's nose in the tent for a \nwhole series of ubicomp applications across society.\n\n    I've been speculating about these new forms of \nubicomp, and giving them some flashy neologisms, because \nthat is what science fiction writers bring to the table.  \nWe build little scenario worlds and make up names for \nthem.  First we've got \"911.net,\" then \"Terrorspace,\" but \nthere are others.\n\nBATTLESPACE.  A term already much-used by the Pentagon.  \nBattlespace means military C4ISR. The \"Revolution in \nMilitary Affairs.\"  I would point out that the military, \nunlike some sectors, is not reneging on their enthusiastic \ncommitment to the digital revolution.  On the contrary.  I \nhaven't seen anybody in the military saying that they long \nto go back to the good-old-fashioned, solid, easy-to-\nunderstand methods of the War in Vietnam.  The military \nare very into \"network-centric warfare,\" and they couldn't \nbe happier about their spysats and surveillance drones.\n\nPROSTHETIC UBICOMP.  This is eldercare.  A huge, steadily \ngrowing market. Alzheimer's disease is a flat-out domestic \ncatastrophe that lasts seven years.  Any computational \nhelp here == in elder-proofing spaces, tracking the sick \nand so forth == would be of huge benefit to society.\n\nCRADLE.NET.  Babies have no privacy.  Children have little \nprivacy. Child-proofing a room against a crawling tot... \nif you've ever done this, you can realize how much use it \nmight be to have this process automated.  Any two-year-old \nalways wonders:  \"Why can't Mr Fork and Miss Wall Socket \nbe friends?\"  A real-time checklist, at the very least!  \nAnd then we're faced with the interesting, large-scale \nprospects of \"K-12.net.\"\n\nSTREET.NET.  This would be traffic management and urban \nsystems management.  Water networks, power networks,\nsubways, sidewalks and so forth.\n\nPUNISH.NET.  Two million people are in the American prison \npopulation.  They've got no privacy.  They've gotta be \nwatched all the time.  They're basically crammed in iron \ncages now.\n\nINDUSTRIAL UBICOMP. Managing supply chains, industrial \nassembly and so forth.  This will eventually be the \nbiggest application.\n\nSO/HO UBICOMP.  Ubicomp in the home, the home office and \nsmall office.  Some very interesting consumer uses here, \nbut in the grand scheme of things, not that big a deal.\n\nSAFETYSPACE.  These would be military bases, U.N. safety \nzones, refugee camps, and disaster evacuation centers.  \nIt's fairly easy to imagine ubiquitous computation as a \nsinister \"gated community\" that walls off privileged areas \nunder threat.  But we can also think of it as importing \nsome human comfort, solidarity, mercy and safety into \nvarious benighted areas that are severely disturbed.  One \ncan imagine a Gorazde UN safe zone version of this, new \nand improved of course: a black helicopter ghosts over in \nthe dead of night, deploys a scattering of small drones, \nsmart-mines and sensors, and suddenly the war just stops \nwithin these bounds of Safetyspace.  Rapine, looting, \nsacking, smashing and burning are  ruled out of existence \nthrough computer awareness.  The handiness of a technique \nlike that for life in the 21st century... well, it might \nbe a bit underestimated.\n\nAnd last, coming up with a bullet should the good times \nreturn in all their carefree glory:  UBITOPIA.  This I \ntake to be ubicomp as an Urban Entertainment Destination.  \nYou go there for fun just because there is cool, wacky \nstuff embedded in the physical world, and it's behaving in \na way that brings joy and hilarity and good spirits, like \nthe funhouse mirror at a digital carnival.  \n\n    When and if Ubitopia really hits, it will mean that \nhumanity's basic relationship with our material goods has \nbeen radically redefined.  That is the apotheosis of \nubiquitous computation. Just: material goods, and the way \nwe deal with them, are different.  Different in character, \ndifferent in quality.  Not recognizable by 20th century \nstandards.\n\n     So. I have no idea if the Homeland Security \ndepartment, or FEMA or DARPA or the NSF, are going to pony \nup any money for any of these notions.  That's not my \nlookout.  I'm a science fiction writer.  And ladies and \ngentlemen, with this material, I have struck platinum.  \nThis stuff is really hot.  This is a great, attractive, \ncontemporary idea that is really new, really different, \nand really ominous.  The implications are huge and they \nspread across the board of society. I am going to be a \nvery busy guy with this material.  If you want to help me, \nsend some email.\n\nThanks a lot for your attention.\n\nO=c=O O=c=O O=c=O\nIT'S HERE\nIT'S THERE\nIT'S EVERYWHERE\nO=c=O O=c=O O=c=O\n\n\n"}
