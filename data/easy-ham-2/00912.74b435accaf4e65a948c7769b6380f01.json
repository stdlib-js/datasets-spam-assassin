And most people who are poor do engage in more reckless\nand stupid behavior in my experience; the people that are a bit smarter\ndon't stay poor for long, so it is a self-selecting population.  Hell, I\ngrew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US and I remember\nquite well why the people that stayed poor were poor -- it certainly\nwasn't because of The Man.  And my parents were poor because they made\nlots of stupid choices -- I had front row seats to the whole process. \nUnlike many others, I actually learned from the experience.\n\nAnd I've known a lot of wealthy people (both in a strict monetary sense\nand general sense), and I can't think of a one that was a fool. People\nwho earned their wealth (i.e. 95+% of the wealthy in the US) didn't\nmanage to do so, and maintain their wealth, because they were fools.  It\nisn't that these people are that much smarter, they just don't make lots\nof bad decisions and stupid mistakes. Being very smart AND not making\nlots of stupid mistakes is pretty much a surefire recipe for being\nwealthy.\n\n\n> Being smart, for example, has made Stephen Hawking famous and \n> respected, but he's not particularly rich.

Smart doesn't make\nyou rich, it gives you the *choice* to be rich. Many people (e.g.\nStephen Hawking) are quite happy merely being comfortable and devote\ntheir energy elsewhere than being \"rich\".  But I don't know too many\nreally smart people that actually choose to live in poverty.\n\n\n> [...ridiculous caricature of wealthy people elided...]\n> At the granular level, the notion that \"most rich people are rich \n> because they're smart\" is so anecdotal and naive that it's not \n> worth arguing about, so I won't.  Still, a compelling point worth \n> some clarification.\n\n\nIt sounds like you've bought into the absurd Hollywood depictions of\nwhat wealthy people are like.  Hint: they are exactly like you and me,\nbut with a higher net worth.  In the U.S., the fact is that two-thirds\nof the millionaires are blue collar folks who worked very smart and very\nhard, and the vast majority of all the wealthy in the U.S. are\ncompletely self-made (i.e. first-generation wealthy).  \"Old wealth\" is\nincredibly rare in the U.S., as it typically comes and goes within three\ngenerations, and the handful that you do hear about are the unusually\nlong-lived exceptions.\n\nIt's quite simple to become wealthy in the U.S. if you put some effort\ninto it.  However, most people prefer to merely be comfortable and\nexpend a lot less energy.  Virtually all the people I know who are\nwealthy are chronic workaholics with above average intelligence and\nexaggerated amounts of drive.  Most people would not consider those\npeople's lives \"fun\", though those people tend to enjoy what they do.\n\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
