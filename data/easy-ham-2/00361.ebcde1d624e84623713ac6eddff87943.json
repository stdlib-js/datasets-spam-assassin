(And, with a good enough sales pitch, you\njust might get away with it!)\n\nHowever, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must \nprovide the sources for that binary if asked.  So I might\nbuy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell\nthat binary for EUR 1.  Of course, I'll need to provide\nthe sources to anyone that asks as well.  But, I just\nmight make money at this, since there might be a market of\n10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of\ngetting a binary.\n\nBut then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for\n1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite\n/bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of\nthe media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is.\n\nYou see, the GPL doesn't force the binaries to be zero-cost\n(or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any\nbusiness plan that solely resells GPL software.  You _can_\ncharge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be\nproviding some value for that money, or you'll go out of\nbusiness faster than a dot-com in 2001.\n\nAnd there are real ways to provide this value for money\n(convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a\nfriendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates,\nconvenience of having what lots of other people have,\nposting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading\nover a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from\na \"real\" company, etc).\n\nThere will be segments of the market that will pay various\namounts for GPL software and there will be others that don't.\nThankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_.  But the\nsource will always be free (or minimal cost).\n\nLater,\nKenn\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
