But this time he's\nseveral years behind. The idea of using epostage\nto stop spam has been discussed quite a bit. The\nproblem is how to get over the adoption hump.\nUntil most people are taking one form of epostage,\nmost people don't have enough incentive to download\nand install something that allows them to pay it.\nUntil most people are set up to pay it, any form of\nepostage I require closes my mailbox to unknown\nsenders from whom I want to receive mail. And even\nfrom known senders. Giving someone my email address\ndoesn't automatically put them in my white list.\n\nHashcash tries to lower the adoption barrier by\nremoving the need to pay money for epostage.\nInstead, the sender burns processing time on his\ncomputer, answering a cryptographically hard\nchallenge. But even this requires set-up. There is\ninadequate incentive to do so until there is a\nstandard mechanism, but no standard mechanism is\nborn until a significant fraction of the market\nhas taken that first step. It may take government\naction, to institute an effective epostage\nstandard!\n\nI think the better idea is to require that people\noff your white list \"hand sign\" email to you. A\ncouple of companies are now trying to implement\nthis. An email sender, if not on your white list,\nmust respond to a verification email or go to a\nwebsite, by a process that is very simply for a\nhuman sender, but difficult for a spammer to\nautomate. Where epostage requires a standard\nmechanism, a variety of mechanisms for \"hand\nsigning\" would frustrate spammers while making it\nno more difficult for legitimate senders. I'm\nhoping Eudora and some of the other big mail\nclients incorporate this kind of feature. The\nadvantage to putting this in the mail client is\nthat the required \"hand sign\" can be personalized:\n\n  \"Your attempt to email David Friedman is\n  blocked until you fill in the blank: The\n  Incredible ______ Machine.\"\n\nIt will be a long time before spammers have a\nprocess that defeats millions of personal\nchallenges. On the other hand, I have a hack in\nmind that would work a large percentage of the\ntime. But I'm not telling. If spammers did figure\nout such hacks, people would then improve their\nchallenges. Yeah, this would lead to another\narms race, and spam would leak through to the\nunwitting. But this arms race is one that helps\nspammers identify and target the part of the\npopulation whose challenges are sub-par, which\nis their natural prey. People like David aren't\nin the market for herbal Viagra or back alley\ndebt consolidation.\n\nSince David is an anarchist, I'm surprised he\ndidn't point out that spam is the result of\ngovernment. The government is ineffective at\npreventing spam, but it DOES prevent individuals\nand ISPs from taking retribution against spammers.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \nhttp://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
