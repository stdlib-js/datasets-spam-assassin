At\n    the same conference in 2001 Perens made a presentation on the\n    triviality of Digital Rights Management systems using exactly the\n    same slides that got Sklyarov arrested.\n\nhttp://www.vnunet.com/News/1133862\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\nBusiness Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com\n\"Computers are useless.
