We have found biomass (large \ncluster of organisms) using methane that geologists show \ncould have existed around four billion years ago,' \nProfessor Antje Boetius, joint author of the study, told \nReuters.\n\nLink:\nYes, she exists.  Dr. Antje does more than exist.  She\ngives some kinda publicity shot.

(((Black, oxygen-free \n\"coral\".  I wonder what that stuff looks like.  Maybe you \ncould make jewelry out of it.)))\n\n     \"That they were able to do so without oxygen suggests \nthey may have been around before plant life.\n\n      \"'Perhaps micro-organisms like those found in the \nBlack Sea were the original inhabitants of the earth \nduring a long period of the earth's history,' said \nBoetius.
