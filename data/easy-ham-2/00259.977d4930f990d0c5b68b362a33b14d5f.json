I would much prefer to be using Linux at work\nso I'm pushing for this. It definately doesn't help when \nyou're given a bog standard Dell box and linux won't work\nwith the graphics card on it.\n\nAt the moment at work, if we want a new workstation, we just\nbuy whatever Sun's latest system is, we jumpstart it, and \nthat's it, it's up and running.\nBasically the whole installation procedure is\n\"boot net - install\"\nThis is exactly what you need when you are administering a large\ngroup of workstations. You don't have the time to check dells\nwebsite every time you want to buy a machine, you'd spend\nyour life on Dells website and messing around with drivers\nand compiling new versions of X. That's fine if you've got\none machine at home, hey, I've done it myself, but\nwhen working with a large bunch of systems, it's impossible.\n\n\nOn Fri, Aug 02, 2002 at 04:02:38AM -0500, Stephen_Reilly@dell.com wrote:\n> > bad thing.
