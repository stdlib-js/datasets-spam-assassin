I always called this \"First Baby Syndrome\". A \nneighbor at one point had a 4 or 5 year old that would choke on jello, \nprobably because she never allowed him to have solid food until he was \nfar too old, IMHO. I fed mine cereal, etc., early and let them get the \nhang of it. I always want my kids to be able to handle anything if I'm \nnot there so I have them try it out when I am. (Within limits of \ncourse.) Of course, I'm now beating up my body at Vans Skate Park trying \nto do 5ft. half pipes on speed skates with my 10 year old daughter.\n\nsdw\n\nGary Lawrence Murphy wrote:\n\n>>>>>>\"t\" == tomwhore  <Tom> writes:\n>>>>>>            \n>>>>>>\n>\n>    t> The first pewp...man they prep you for it but northing really\n>    t> can...Wowzer that stuff is road tar.\n>\n>First kid, eh? ;)\n>\n>No, there's no prep for it.
