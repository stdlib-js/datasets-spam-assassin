The battle raged for hours, but, i'm glad\nto inform you, i emerged victorious. The problem was as follows:\n\tIt's very easy to get one program to act on the output of a second\nprogram: cmd1 | cmd2. But, what if you want cmd1 to act on the output of\ncmd2 as well? Hmm. Eventually, I came up with this solution:\n\n\tmkfifo io\n\tcmd1 <io | cmd2 > io\n\t\nand bingo, all was well with the world. Now, I have (and had) a sneaking\nsuspcion that it might be possible to do this without using a fifo, and\ncan be done using something like:\n\n\texec 3>&1\n\tcmd1 <&3 | cmd2 >&3\n\texec 3>&-\n\nbut that doesn't work in that form, and i couldn't work out an\nincantation that would. Anyone got any suggestions? Anyway, victory is\nmine, and i is happy person once again. In case you were wondering, the\naim of all of this was to write a shell script that could check for new\nmail on an imap server.\n\nSteve\n-- \n\"Oh look, it's the Pigeon of Love.\"\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
