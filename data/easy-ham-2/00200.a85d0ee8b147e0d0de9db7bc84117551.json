For example, the\nsimplest Chinese IM is Pinyin where you phonetically spell out\neach character using the pinyin romanisation rules.  For example,\nZhong Guo (Chinese for China) is entered by typing 'zhong',\nthen you're prompted with a list of possible matches, with the\nmost common first in a numbered list, so you hit, say, 2 for\nthe second in the list, then similarly for 'guo' 3.\n\nYou can see, that, regarding keystroke counts, it's not that\nmuch different to English.  However, until you get familiar\nwith the sorting order in the 'possible match' lists, it can\nbe a little slow.\n\nOther input methods are more keystroke-efficient, losing the\nphonetic simplicity of Pinyin.  Chinese characters are almost\nalways pronounced as a first-part-second-part, so zhong is\n'zh'-'ong'.  One input method assigns single letters to\nthe possible first and second parts, so 'i' might represent\n'zh' as a first part and 'ong' as a second part, so you'd\nenter zhong as 'ii' and a digit to choose from the possible\nmatches.\n\nI think the Microsoft Global IME has a 'stroke' mode where\nyou can build up a character stroke by stroke, but you'd only\nuse that when you know the character you want but you don't\nknow how to pronounce it.\n\n> \n>  some XIMs compose \"in place\", others do it on a special line,\n>  and some seem to do it in a special window (or the root?).\n>  also, some(/most?)

That's what the Microsoft Global\nInput Method Editor uses and what xcin uses IIRC.\n\nRegarding the original poster's question - here's what works for me\non Red Hat 7.2\n\no  Make sure the xcin and ttfonts-zh_CN RPMs are installed.  (The\n   fonts might not be essential, I think XFree comes with usuable\n   Chinese fonts in the XFree86-fonts RPMs\n\no  Select Chinese (Simplified) as the language in GDM when logging\n   in.\n\nEverything should 'just work'.  If you've got the default clock in\nyour GNOME panel, you should now see it in Chinese.  A lot of the\nmenus will also be in Chinese, but you should be able to find your\nway around.\n\nUse Ctrl-Space to toggle between Chinese and English input.  When \nin Chinese mode Shift-Space toggles between something that I don't\nunderstand, but it blocks exiting to English.  So if you can't use\nCtrl-Space to get back to English, try hitting Shift-Space, Ctrl-Space.\n\nFire up a GNOME terminal.  In Chinese mode, type zhong 1 guo 1 and \nyou'll see the Chinese for China.\n\nGetting this to work while selecting English at the GDM screen is left\nas an exercise for the reader.  Looking at /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/xinput\nand /usr/share/doc/xcin should give enough info.\n\nLater,\nKenn\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
