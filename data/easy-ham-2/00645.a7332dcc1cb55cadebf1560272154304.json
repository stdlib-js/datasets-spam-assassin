But the other 99,000 will never see that spam.  Evenly distributed, it means that an average user will only see 1% of spam.  That's not realistic, because not everyone will get the same spam, but the basic threshold can be adjusted.  At the very least, 30 people need to \"vote\" on a given piece of mail to make a realistic decision.  Since there's no \"no\" vote mechanism (except revocation--and that's after the fact), only a \"yes\" vote mechanism exists and so if you received 30 \"yes\" votes then you could safely say that you got a reasonable sample.\n\nThe system could pretend to have never seen the piece of mail until after it determined that it was probably spam.  So instead of a rating going up incrementally, it would take a big leap at the beginning (from undefined to a relatively high number) and then go from there.  So after the first group of people (our samplers, we'll say) have seen the spam, no one else would ever see it.\n\nAs far as unsubscribing, I'm always leery of clicking on the link (and don't do so unless I specifically remember signing up for something), but the sample population will decide for themselves whether they feel that it's spam.\n\nSo ultimately, I guess I'm saying that the most effective route would be to use a constantly changing sample pool and just accept that there is some fraction of users that will have to see the spam.  In a system that depends on people deciding whether or not something is spam, is there any other way?\n\nIsaac\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Patrick\nSent: Wednesday, August 14, 2002 2:13 PM\nTo: Oates, Isaac\nCc: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net\nSubject: Re: [Razor-users] many vs one\n\nOn Wed, 14 Aug 2002, Oates, Isaac wrote:\n\n> I'm new to razor but have studied trust systems before.

A\nsimplistic view would be that 999 subscribers received a piece of spam\nthat could have otherwise been avoided. But the reality is likely that\nmany, many more individuals would have received the piece of spam when you\nfactor in report times.\n\n> By having the server pretend to never have seen it, you can avoid\n> people who just re-report spam because it was already marked as spam,\n> something that is completely useless.\n\nWrong. razor-check will tell you if a specific piece of mail matches\nsomething already in the database. If you have the system pretend to have\nnever seen a piece of mail, how do you propose people use the system for\nfiltering?\n\n> What about revocations?

Rather the 1000 people\nwho have reported the message as spam constitute a majority or not is\nsomething that would have to be determined in the context of the\nindividual message.\n\n> instead of messing with its rating, why not just put\n> it on the whitelist?
