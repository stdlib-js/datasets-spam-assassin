Are applied\ncrypto people suffering higher rates of unemployment than general\napplication programmers?  (From my statistically too small sample of\nacquaintances it might appear so.)\n\nIf this is so, why is it?\n\n- you might think the physical security push following the world\npolitical instability worries following Sep 11th would be accompanied\nby a corresponding information security push -- jittery companies\nimproving their disaster recovery and to a lesser extent info sec\nplans.\n\n- governments are still harping on the info-war hype, national\ninformation infrastructure protection, and the US Information Security\nCzar Clarke making grandiose pronouncements about how industry ought\nto do various things (that the USG spent the last 10 years doing it's\nbest to frustrate industry from doing with it's dumb export laws)\n\n- even Microsoft has decided to make a play of cleaning up it's\nsecurity act (you'd wonder if this was in fact a cover for Palladium\nwhich I think is likely a big play for them in terms of future control\npoints and (anti-)competitive strategy -- as well as obviously a play\nfor the home entertainment system space with DRM)\n\nHowever these reasons are perhaps more than cancelled by:\n\n- dot-com bubble (though I saw some news reports earlier that though\nthere is lots of churn in programmers in general, that long term\nunemployment rates were not that elevated in general)\n\n- perhaps security infrastructure and software upgrades are the first\nthings to be canned when cash runs short?  \n\n- software security related contract employees laid off ahead of\nfull-timers?  Certainly contracting seems to be flat in general, and\nespecially in crypto software contracts look few and far between.  At\nleast in the UK some security people are employed in that way (not\nfamiliar with north america).\n\n- PKI seems to have fizzled compared to earlier exaggerated\nexpectations, presumably lots of applied crypto jobs went at PKI\ncompanies downsizing.  (If you ask me over use of ASN.1 and adoption\nof broken over complex and ill-defined ITU standards X.500, X.509\ndelayed deployment schedules by order of magnitude over what was\nstrictly necessary and contributed to interoperability problems and I\nthink significantly to the flop of PKI -- if it's that hard because of\nthe broken tech, people will just do something else.)\n\n- custom crypto and security related software development is perhaps\nweighted towards dot-coms that just crashed.\n\n- big one probably: lack of measurability of security -- developers\nwith no to limited crypto know-how are probably doing (and bodging)\nmost of the crypto development that gets done in general, certainly\ncontributing to the crappy state of crypto in software.  So probably\nfailure to realise this issue or perhaps just not caring, or lack of\nfinancial incentives to care on the part of software developers.\nMicrosoft is really good at this one.  The number of times they\nre-used RC4 keys in different protocols is amazing!\n\n\nOther explanations?  Statistics?  Sample-of-one stories?\n\nAdam\n--\nyes, still employed in sofware security industry; and in addition have\nbeen doing crypto consulting since 97 (http://www.cypherspace.net/) if\nyou have any interesting applied crypto projects; reference\ncommissions paid.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
