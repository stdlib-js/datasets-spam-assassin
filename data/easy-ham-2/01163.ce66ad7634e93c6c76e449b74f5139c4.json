I think Mandrake also makes these kind of empty\npackages.\n\nAnyway, their use has been discussed here a while back, and personally\nalthough I do agree that they can be useful at times, I don't really like\nthem. For me it's more of an ugly \"hack\" than anything else, and I'd\napprove completely a system that would enable to install/remove entire\ncategories of software... but not if achieved by building empty packages.\n\nAlso, you can trivially do \"apt-get install <metapackage>\", but removing\nall that it installed is a bit less trivial, and could be implemented in a\ntrivial and clean fashion if using some functionality meant to do this.\n\nMatthias\n\n-- \nMatthias Saou                                World Trade Center\n-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta\nSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain\nElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
