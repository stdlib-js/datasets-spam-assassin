After all, most \nchroniclers of Russian life base their tales in Moscow or, alternately, \nSt. Petersburg, the most livable of Russia's not-very-livable cities. \nDeciding instead to settle in a former academic community outside of \nNovosibirsk, one of Siberia's major cities, Blakely set out to pursue, \nas his book's subtitle declares, \"the American dream on Russia's wild \nfrontier.\"\n\nBlakely, who moved to Siberia after finishing college with an economics \ndegree, has a breezy writing style. And although his book is flawed in \nmany respects, it does include some sharp observations of life in \nRussia. \"Usually with construction,\" he tells us, for instance, \"you \nhave two choices: 1) you can do it quickly, or 2) you can do it right. \nThe Soviet construction worker . . . takes his time doing things wrong.\"\n\nAnyone who has spent time in Siberia knows that its inhabitants are a \nbreed apart. They disdain their compatriots in the country's Western \nregions and pride themselves -- perhaps excessively -- on their courage, \nstrength and inner fortitude. Siberia, in fact, occupies a space in the \nRussian national psyche similar to that of the Wild West in American \nmythology. The efforts throughout the 16th and 17th centuries to settle \nSiberia's vast expanse and exploit its natural resources still resonate \nwith Russians. So does the region's role as a convenient dumping ground \nfor criminals and political dissidents during the czarist centuries and \nas home to the cruel network of gulags in Soviet times.\n\nUnfortunately, little of this rich brew of history and myth makes an \nappearance in Siberia Bound. Neither do lots of other pertinent facts. \nRussians often say that, in Russia, anything can happen -- and usually \ndoes. So it's easy to believe that two young men could establish a \nchocolate business on little more than hope, smarts and chutzpah. But \nwhile Blakely describes establishing a cocoa-bean importing business \nwith his friend Sasha, we never learn how they met in the first place or \nwhy he believes Sasha to be a trustworthy associate. The two of them \nstrike a deal to sell their beans to a local chocolate factory, yet we \nfind out virtually nothing about the chocolate the factory produces. Is \nit tasty? Disgusting? Are we talking chocolate bars, chocolate truffles \nor chocolate syrup? A few details would go a long way here.\n\nThe author has the makings of a terrific story. But even though Siberia \nBound includes frequent humorous episodes, Blakely generally fails to \ntransform the pungent ingredients into a satisfying meal. The constant \ndescriptions of encounters and conversations ultimately differ little \nfrom one another. People are forever winking, smirking and slapping one \nanother on the back. Slamming down shots of vodka and making sentimental \ntoasts to women and friendship play an inevitable role in any account of \nRussian life, but reading about such occasions becomes tiresome after \nthe 20th or 30th repetition.\n\nBlakely is also given to facile comments that are meant to sound smart \nbut often fall flat. \"Democracy and the free market, the best \ninstitutions the West had to offer, stormed over the borders and ran \ndeep into Russia,\" he tells us. \"But like all foreign armies throughout \nhistory, they quickly were spread too thin and became diluted.\" And then \nthere's this summation of his time in Russia: \"Those four years have \nleft me with a lifetime of rabid ambivalence to chew on until I've got \nno teeth left.\"\n\nBlakely manages to include a few unpleasant -- and wholly unnecessary -- \nlaughs at the expense of Chinese workers and gays. And although I like \nwordplay as much as the next guy, it's jarring when non-English-speaking \ncharacters make puns in English. \"In a pinch,\" says one character, a \nchocolate factory director who warns Blakely not to store extra cocoa \nbeans on site, \"I'm afraid we would probably take a pinch.\"\n\nSome of these faults wouldn't matter if Siberia Bound were a picaresque \nnovel or an account that didn't aspire to authenticity. But the effect \nhere is to undermine a reader's faith in the narrator's reliability and \nto reduce most of the characters to the stock figures encountered in \ndozens of other accounts of Russian life. So in the end, I believed the \nbroad contours of Blakely's story but found it hard to take seriously \nmany of the particulars. And his ultimate conclusion -- that capitalism, \nmaterial comfort and wealth do not bring happiness -- hardly qualifies \nas a revelation. �\n\nDavid Tuller is a contributing writer at Salon.com and the author of \n\"Cracks in the Iron Closet: Travels in Gay and Lesbian Russia.\"\n\n\n� 2002 The Washington Post Company\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
