I have read the Samab documentation in  large quantities\ndown through the years but as I've never wanted to do anything like this, I\nnever paid much attention to all the stuff about domain controllers etc.\nwhich I presume is what I will need to have running here.\n\nI would also like, if at all possible, to have synchronisation of passwords\nbetween the NIS domain and the NIS server's Samba with minimal manual\nintervention.\n\nIdeas, accompanied by annotated Samba configration files :-) , gratefully\nreceived.\n\n\n\n\nNiall\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
