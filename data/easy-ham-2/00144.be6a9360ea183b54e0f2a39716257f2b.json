If the company in\nquestion knows plenty about Linux and nothing about FreeBSD, I'd go\nwith a Linux box, merely because when something goes wrong (that\nisn't got to do with ipfw/ipchains/ipfilter), then someone knows how\nto fix it.\n\nAs I said before, I have little to no in-depth experience with\nnetfilter, I'm aware of it's basic capabilities and had a quick look\nat it's features in early 2.4 editions but that's it.\n\n-- \n  Philip Reynolds        \n   RFC Networks          tel: 01 8832063\nwww.rfc-networks.ie      fax: 01 8832041\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
