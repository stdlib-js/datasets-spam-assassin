Big airport fun there.\nThe flexi-PCB connecting the halves is probably only good for 100,000 flexes too.\n(The keyboard is $200-400, hence minor concern.)\n\nKind of useless for keysigning though; is it not law that when you have to sign,\nyou will be packed and ready to leave/arrive elsewhere?  Thats why F-u-F-mi\nis such a handy accessible proxy signing method and Dragon Naturally\nAuthorized canceled its IPO.\n\tSeriously, the nifty Palm thing where you enter your password\nand (or by) a series of naturally cryptic buttonpressed and screentaps is a\ngood method.
