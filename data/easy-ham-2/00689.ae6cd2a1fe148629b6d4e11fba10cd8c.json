I haven't \nbeen helping that situation much, although there are some comments in the new \nsequence stuff that I wrote.  I have cleaned up a bit of code so that \nit's a little more clear what it's doing and a little less delicate.  I also \ngratuitously renamed some variables for clarity.\n\nMy last few bug fixes were purely problems that I created in my own \npatches and I can't blame anyone but myself.\n\nAs I'm avoiding real work, I may clean up a little bit more (and probably \nbreak a few things as well ;-).\n\nChris\n\n-- \nChris Garrigues                 http://www.DeepEddy.Com/~cwg/\nvirCIO                          http://www.virCIO.Com\n716 Congress, Suite 200\nAustin, TX  78701\t\t+1 512 374 0500\n\n  World War III:  The Wrong-Doers Vs. the Evil-Doers.\n\n\n\n\n--==_Exmh_724731589P\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Exmh version 2.2_20000822 06/23/2000\n\niD8DBQE9PFUbK9b4h5R0IUIRAk/OAJ90HUYnMoAhyeIUTuHB7FnwZxl/LQCeIHH7\nA+FDAIyH8bUPCObpEiimZMg=\n=8FKS\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n--==_Exmh_724731589P--\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n\n"}
