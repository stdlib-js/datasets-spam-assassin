I hope they aren't intending to release a new RH with a new gcc\nwhich hasn't yet been released (again). Bad enough the first time, and\nI'm sure it gave RedHat a lot of embarrassment.\n\nFWIW, I've yet to compile apt on the gcc 3.2 snapshot in RawHide - apt's\nC++ makes several rather poor assumptions on what iterators are, and in\naddition doesn't use namespaces at all.\n\nFor non-C++ folk, this basically means it needs porting. I've got a\nreasonable way along, now, and I'll send a suitable patch to Connectiva\nor somewhere when I succeed - I can't find anything on Connectiva's site\nitself for this.\n\nIn addition, the rpmlib stuff has changed slightly - I've not really\nstarted on this, but it's mainly just arguments added. The rpmlib\ndocumentation seems somewhat poor, though, unless I've missed it.\n\nDave.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
