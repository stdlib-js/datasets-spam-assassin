That was the =\nday my company, IDT, one of the world's largest Internet and alternative =\ntelecommunications providers, went public. As IDT's founder, president, =\nand majority shareholder, I was instantly rich beyond my wildest dreams. =\nPeople ask me if this was the greatest moment in my business life. It =\nwasn't.\n\nFour months later, on July 18, 1996, we released a new technology, a =\nbreakthrough that would eventually cut the cost of international calls =\nby a remarkable 95 percent. That day Sara Grosvenor, the =\ngreat-granddaughter of Alexander Graham Bell, joined us in New York to =\nuse our new technology in order to place the first phone call ever over =\nthe network to Susan Cheever, the great-granddaughter of Thomas Watson, =\nin London.\n\nWithin twenty-four hours of Ms. Grosvenor saying \"Come here, Ms. Watson, =\nI need to see you\" over our system, CNN, CNBC, and newspapers had spread =\nword of the development to investors and potential users and partners =\naround the world. Combined with a more than fivefold increase in our =\nquarterly revenues for the second year in a row, IDT's stock price =\nstarted to move upward again. Many people who saw me glowing that =\nmorning asked if this was the greatest moment of my business life. It =\nwasn't.\n\nThe greatest moment actually occurred approximately twenty-seven years =\nearlier on the morning of July 23, 1970. That was the morning I pushed =\nmy newly built hot dog stand past Joe and Vinny's butcher shop on =\nEastchester Road in the Bronx. Only two months before, Joe had driven me =\nfrom my after-school job in the butcher shop by forcing me to eat five =\npounds of rice pudding (a task that took me close to two hours) after =\ncatching me sampling the pudding while I waited on a customer at the =\ndeli counter.\n\nI couldn't resist stopping in front of the butcher shop on my way to the =\nspot I'd picked out three-quarters of a mile away to set up my stand. As =\nJoe, Vinny, and Joe's nephew, Patsy, came out to see the new stand, I =\nwas gloating over the fact that I was now just as independent in =\nbusiness as they were. Nobody could make me clean out the rotten chicken =\ntank anymore. Nobody could send me five miles away on the delivery bike =\nin the snow to deliver ribs to a rich finicky lady who would just send =\nthem back to be trimmed, and never tipped more than a quarter. Nobody =\ncould make me lay in the sawdust and dig ground-up bones, blood, and fat =\nout of the meat band saw. And, most importantly, nobody could do all =\nthis while poking fun at what a jerk I was to get all the dirty jobs. I =\nwas only fourteen years old, and the wheels would fall off my homemade =\nhot dog stand many times before that summer ended, but that day, in my =\nmind, I was as rich as a Rockefeller.\n\n\n\n------=_NextPart_000_0072_01C24561.DAA02DB0\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=\"iso-8859-1\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\">\n<HTML><HEAD>\n<META content=3D\"text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1\" =\nhttp-equiv=3DContent-Type>\n<META content=3D\"MSHTML 5.00.2920.0\" name=3DGENERATOR>\n<STYLE></STYLE>\n</HEAD>\n<BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Hi People,</FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>I'm rejoining Fork after a long hiatus, =\nand=20\ninspired by the kinds of stuff Rohit and Adam used to post once upon a =\ntime...=20\nhere's a little something that's damn inspiring...</FONT></DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Nalin</FONT></DIV>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2><A=20\nhref=3D\"http://www.howardsbook.com/ch01/01.html\">http://www.howardsbook.c=\nom/ch01/01.html</A></FONT></DIV>\n<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>\n<DIV><FONT face=3DArial size=3D2><FONT size=3D4><STRONG>Chapter =\nOne<BR>One Finger for=20\nOnions</STRONG></FONT> </DIV>\n<DIV align=3Dleft>\n<P><FONT size=3D2>On March 15, 1996, I made over a hundred million =\ndollars.
