It is as if the\nMakefile does not allow overrides, or does not have those variables.\"\n\nI note that:\n\n1) It's one of those Makefile.PL things.\n2) While I know that Makefiles generated by a ./configure generated in\nturn by a later version of auto* do support the technique you're trying,\nI know nothing about what the Perl MakeMaker (or whatever it is)\nsupports.\n\nThe general solution for cases like this is to install manually (Try\nmake -n and see what it does). I think that Perl's installer system\nmight support an installation root, though I've blissfully no idea how\nto operate it.\n\nI suggest finding a small Perl module SRPM and looking at the spec file\nto see how RedHat (or Turbo, or PLD, although RedHat generally know\n*all* the tricks) do it.\n\nDave.\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
