Plots of that data show us passing through\nhundreds of 'tubes' of debris, each indicative of some other larger\nsomething out there, only a small handful of which have been\ndiscovered.  This is without even considering the one's headed this\nway out of the Oort for their First Big Trip.\n\nOne thing you will just have to get used to is hearing news of a\npossible collision; we have only started funding the projects to look\nfor these things since Hollywood took an interest with Armageddon, and\nwe have only just recently turned on a bunch of new toys to do\nautomated sky surveys.  There are also some new (and very clever)\namateur projects co-ordinating multiple telescopes to detect these\ncriters, one of which plans to network dozens of ground based machines\naround the world.  You may remember a few years back the 2028 doomsday\nstory -- consider them good ghost stories, then go back to work.\n\n20,000 years ago, one of them the size of Mt Everest just ever so\nslightly grazed us and left a scar 400km long in the side of South\nAmerica before it scooted out into space.  First nations people would\nhave been there then, and it would have seriously ruined their day.\nOrbital elements tell us that our modern technology would have perhaps\ngiven us 90-min advance warning.   \n\nThe near-miss earlier this month wasn't seen until it was already past\nus; we can't detect rocks on their trip behind the Sun, and when they\ncome out slingshot to relativistic speeds, well, it's just too darn\nlate to do much of anything about it.  On the inbound trip, even at\ntheir max full-moon angle, these things are most often magnitude 16 or\nway worse, which is many magnitudes fainter than what you see in the\ndeepest dark-skies; no one thought to paint them shiny and white.\nThey day before it \"hits\" my software says NT7 will be magnitude 14 --\nit's easier to see the space station.\n\nWhat's worse, the Sun is not a smooth hard spheric marble, it's a\ntwisted gelatinous hunk o' hunk o' burnin' love, so the precise warp\ncurve of space right near it's backside is (ahem) somewhat problematic\nto compute precisely.  It's also spewing considerable plasma flux in\nall directions, and then there's all these other big gelatinous roaming\nglobs (Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune) and some significant roaming\nrubble (us), and damn it, they are all spinning too, and most of them\nhave a magnetosphere!\n\nShit. Forget it.\n\nLearn to play the banjo. Take peppermint Rye-Kee Shee-At-Zoo relaxation\ntherapy and oodles of Ag-nasial I&I-drop suppliments, eat no kind of\nfrozen portion, and floss.  Good planets are real hard to find, so\nenjoy the one you got while it's here.  Call your ma. Do an anonymous\nkindness for your better half, another for a total stranger. Having\nall the best toys is useless when they all spontaneously combust from\na global Wormwood shockwave. You should be diggin' it while it's\nhappenin'\n\nLike, just live your life like there's no tomorrow, ok?  Don't bank on\nbeing able to redeem yourself later. Yeah, sure, Osama could whack you\nwith some nail-coated fuel-air bombs, heck a mis-informed TopGun could\ndo it too, but the Good Lord could do it too, with pure, clean and\ngalactically EnviroFriendly kinetic energy, and He don't stand in line\nfor no Airport Security Check. Hell, fire and brimstone are\nclassically given in the reverse order; best to be on the impact side\nof the planet.\n\nLearn to stop worrying and love the Rock.  Besides, the rats and\ncockroaches will survive, and they already know how to kickstart\nevolution right back into Enrons, WorldComs and Calcuttas.  They even\nhave all our wiring and plumbing diagrams and half of our socks.\n\nAre we going to get hit?  Yup.  \n\nWhen?  Every 65 million years and, oh my lord, will you /look/ at the time!\n\nWhere/what/when? Space is pretty big.  Take the largest thing you can\nimagine, double it, and add 10%: That is just the local pancake region\nbetween us and the Sun. There's the whole rest of the disk of the\necliptic and, which is where the NT7 observation came from, it has\nonly recently occurred to the meteor hunters to \"look up\" (or down);\nalmost the first shot looking /out/ of the ecliptic disk, and hoo-whee\nthere's this big sucker on an \"11 tries for a dollar\" close encounter\nof the smack-em-good kind.\n\nThis is what I love about astrophysics: we have theories as good as\nanyone else (way better than psychology), and we debate and argue and\nexpound and conference and bellow and blurt about them, but every time\nwe turn on some new kind of robot sensor device to actually /look/ at\nReality, well she slaps us right in the face and says in her best Mae\nWest \"Guess again, boys\" -- no other science gets that chance (ok,\nmaybe some do) and there is nothing, _nothing_ more worthless than last\nsemester's astronomy text.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\nBusiness Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com\n\"Computers are useless.
