Yes, you can query the SNMP \ncommunity string...  And yes, it's the default PW (not to mention the \nESSID and last 5 characters of the default WEP key...)  But they're all \neasily changed, and indeed, it is highly recommended to do so in the \nmanual.\n\nAnyone who changes the default settings would not be vulnerable to this \nparticular SNMP probe.  Of course, you can't account for end user \nstupidity, but that's beyond the scope of this advisory.  ;)\n\n> Vendor Response:\n>\n> Both vendors were notified of this issue on July 8th, 2002.
