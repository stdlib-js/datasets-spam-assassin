Its just like IBM (mwave dsp chip ?)\n(shared video/main memory ?)in the old days. I know you can flip a \nmboard jumper switch to turn crap off and install your own cards \nbut why bother ?\n\nTo clarify my point is this ....\nDell makes excellent machines and I would recomend their machines and \ntheir aftersales support over any other manufacturer that I can think of.\nHowever if you want that box for linux and you have a life and you dont\nwant to spend a week of it fucking arround and googling to get that box\nworking properly be damned sure you do your research before you buy it.\nAnd this especially applies to their budget machines.\n\nAnd this isn't taking a swing at you John but ...\n\n>>Just a bad thing for those that hope a distro will work out of\n>>the box.\n\nA lot of the time the reason that you encounter this is cause someone has \nsuch a box and they say to you \"hey can you install that linux code that I\ngot\nfrom the guy in the internet cafe\" :-) and you say sure and you go to their\nhouse \n(without a net connection/56k modem). And the machine has got this crap\nwindoze\nonly hardware and eventually you shrug in frustration and they say \n\"well I didn't expect much from something thats free anyhow\"\n\nWhen Dell were squabbling with Windows and it looked as though there might\nbe \na Dell/Redhat alliance my Inspiron 4000 was produced ... it worked a treat,\nnow that dell doesn't give a shit about linux all their new cheap boxes are\nlinux \nincompatable in small ways.\n\n--B\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: John P.

Same happens in windows - you have to go get your drivers.\n\n Yes, dell use the most recent stuff they can, to save money. That's not a\nbad thing. Just a bad thing for those that hope a distro will work out of\nthe box.\n\nKate\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
