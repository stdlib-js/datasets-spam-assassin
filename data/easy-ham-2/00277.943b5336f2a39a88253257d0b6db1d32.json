I tried it (over a year ago) and it sucked like a new vacuum\ncleaner. Although I expect that it will be a lot better by now. What I would\nreally like to see is Gnome on one of the Sun Ray thin terminals.\n\n> Out of curiosity, does `normal fashion` mean that you still have to do the\n> interactive customisations or is it like Solaris jumpstart where you can\n> specify everything on the install server, do `boot net - install` go home,\nand\n> come in to a fully installed and patched desktop the next morning?\n\nEr, I mean normal fashion for a Linux install. This would be distro\nspecific, anyway.\n\nI am sure it would be possible to do an automated install with a few script\nchanges. I would not be surprised if Debian does this already.\n\nI do know that if you pass extra parameters on the boot command, they are\npicked up by silo. So:\n  boot disk linux\n\nwould not prompt for selection but would boot straight through. From there\nit is a matter of tftp'ing the correct config file and the install would be\nautomatic from there on.\n\n> I don't see why this should be a _major problem.

The other problem is that sometimes Linux will drop in to the PROM\non shutdown instead of powering off or rebooting. Without a serial cable or\nkeyboard it is not possible to reboot the box without flicking the power\nswitch hidden at the back of the case.\n\nI think if the console is ttya/ttyS0 it will drop into PROM. If it is\n/dev/null then you do not get console messages but the box will shut down\nproperly.\n\n- Matthew\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\nhttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
