Prepare LILO to boot the new disk\n\n   (Thanks to Rick Masters for helping with this.)\n\n   We're  assuming  that LILO is installed on the hard disk's Master Boot\n   Record (MBR); this seems to be the most common configuration. You want\n   to  install  LILO  on  what's  presently the second hard disk but will\n   become the first hard disk.\n\n   Edit the file /new-disk/etc/lilo.conf as follows:\n\n        disk=/dev/hdb bios=0x80       # Tell LILO to treat the second\n                                      # disk as if it were the first\n                                      # disk (BIOS ID 0x80).\n        boot=/dev/hdb                 # Install LILO on second hard\n                                      # disk.\n        map=/new-disk/boot/map        # Location of \"map file\".\n        install=/new-disk/boot/boot.b # File to copy to hard disk's\n                                      # boot sector.\n        prompt                        # Have LILO show \"LILO boot:\"\n                                      # prompt.\n        timeout=50                    # Boot default system after 5\n                                      # seconds. (Value is in tenths of\n                                      # seconds.)\n        image=/new-disk/boot/vmlinuz  # Location of Linux kernel.
