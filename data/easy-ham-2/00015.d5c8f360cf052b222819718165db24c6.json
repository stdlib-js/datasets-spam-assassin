Start drilling right\nthrough the center of the head, at a slow speed so you don't pop\noff and through the board!  Once you have a bit of an indent in,\nincrease the speed a little bit.\n\nIf you've made a deepish indent, and the head doesn't pop off, use\nthe next largest drill bit you have.  Repeat until happy.\n\nEventually the head should just pop off, allowing you to lift the\nboard off over the shaft of the screw... then ye can take out the\nrest fairly easily with a pliers or whatnot.\n\n-- \n\tNiall\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
