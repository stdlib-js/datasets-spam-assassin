A number of new standards\nand commercial products are emerging, offering a basis for developing\nWeb-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the\nrange and scope of services that can be made available through the Web.\n\nThe goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web\ndesign, software engineering, and information technology communities to\ndiscuss techniques for migrating to Web services. Architectural styles and\ntool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse.\nExpertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and\nexperience accounts are lacking. The explosion of non-traditional computing\nplatforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and\nInternet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation\nof form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the\nWeb.\n\nWSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related\nto exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not\nlimited to):\n\n*   Migrating to Web services\n*   Web quality determination and improvement through process and product\ncontrol\n*   Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable\n*   Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure\n*   Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple\nplatforms\n*   Applying traditional software engineering activities such as\narchitecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites\n*   Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolution\n\nWSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software\nMaintenance (ICSM 2002). ICSM is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship event\nfocused on the modernization of existing systems. ICSM 2002's theme of\n\"maintaining distributed heterogeneous systems\" nicely compliments WSE\n2002's overall theme and goals.\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
