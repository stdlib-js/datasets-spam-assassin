Trouble is the fish were also\ninterested in a feed and they were significantly faster than the cats. [They\ncould'nt actually hurt them as they only eat fish/very small rodents] in the\nwild. But the cats got the fright of their lives and now they just sit\nacross the room from the fish warey of approaching the glass ;-)\n\nPersonally I've been bitten many times, but only drew blood once so far.\n\nI wan't to thank all that replied to my totally OT mail, I never knew that\nso many people were into our wee friends. \n\nCW\n\n-----------------\nOn Sat, 20 Jul 2002, kevin lyda wrote:\n\n> what is this obsession of yours with cats that hunt? \n\nnot my obsession - evolutions.\n\nanyway.. i dont like mice and rats, esp. not in the house. and we've\nnot had one in the house since we got our present cat.\n\n> you realise that while cats will sometimes bring birds to your bed,\n> it's the wrong kind of bird...  :)\n\n:)\n\nits mostly mice though. and they will eventually (after a few summers)\nstop bringing their kills back to the house, once they realise that\nyou're not interested and are never going to learn to hunt.\n\n(they're trying to teach you hunting basically. they do the same with\nkittens - first bring back kills, and then later they bring back live\nbut injured prey for the kittens to practice on).\n\nalthough they'll still bring back stuff on occassion.\n\n> kevin\n\n--paulj\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group Social Events: social@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/social for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
