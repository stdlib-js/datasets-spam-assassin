Kinda sucks to be an ant farming for the \ncorporate lords. Funny how most of the rest of the world is more and \nmore apprehensive towards American Democracy.\n\nI just went to DC for the first time. I was awestruck by the \nmonuments, the words of Thomas Jefferson, the Spirit of Democracy set \nin stone. Amazing to think that in little more than 200 years our \ngovernment could be so far removed from those honorable principles. \nAdam Smith presumed that the marketplace would regulate itself \nthrough morality, good faith, and responsibility. Corporate America \nseems to feel that those principles stand in the way of making the \nreal bucks. How much more can they co-opt and commodify? Get your \ncopyrights in quick so you can hold on to your piece of the pie. \nHealth care, public programs, pensions, social security - these are \nnow regarded as worthless unless they can turn a profit.\n\nAh, socialized medicine. Siestas. 6 week vacation leave. I hear Spain \nis nice this time of year...\n\nAt 2:35 PM -0700 7/25/02, Adam L.
