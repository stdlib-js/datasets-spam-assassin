If a mail contains MIME\n  boundaries it is split on those boundaries, each MIME part is considered \n  when marking the mail as spam.\n  \n  In 2.14, there are different 'logic methods' for detecting spam.\n  The default method 5 requires all non-contention parts to be spam for\n  the mail to be marked as spam.  A part is considered under\n  contention if its not clear if its spam are not, and is relatively\n  rare.\n\n  Sounds like you are not using 2.14, or maybe you're misinterpreting\n  the log files.  Feel free to send me the log files if you think \n  there is a bug.\n\n  Also, as jordan says, if you get a legit mail marked as spam (based\n  on whatever MIME stuff is going on), you should revoke it (which sends\n  all parts in) so TeS can take care of business.  \n\n  cheers,\n  chad\n\nOn 19/08/02 07:41 -0700, Jordan Ritter wrote:\n) If I understand you correctly, you should revoke the message en total,\n) because this is one of various inputs that TeS uses to understand what\n) parts are under contention.  \n) \n) As for your question specifically, Chad can answer that (sorry, I\n) don't know).\n) \n) --jordan\n) \n) On Mon, Aug 19, 2002 at 09:14:17AM -0500, Steve Price wrote:\n) \n) # Is there an easy way in Razor v2 to turn off detecting a message as\n) # SPAM if one of the MIME parts was found in a previous SPAM?
