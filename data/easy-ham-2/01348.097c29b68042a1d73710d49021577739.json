In order to proactively\nprotect endusers they'll need to put such code (or part of it) into\ntheir defs. Since antivirus products still gets smarter and smarter and\nheuristics are getting better and better the odds aginst not running\ninto false positives are poor. Some products will woe plenty of these\nsome are better to avoid the madness (!). I'll leave you to do the test.\nConsider that corporate and endusers are most likely using Microsoft\nsoftware without updating as they should. AV-software is now trying to\nprotect these poor souls adding proxy functionality to catch e.g.\nmalicious content in HTML based e-mails and for a good reason.
