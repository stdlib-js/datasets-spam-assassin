A lot. It crashed on me many times while working on my projects. \nLater \"versions\" of \"2.96\" fixed this, but it was well after 3.0 was \nreleased that it finally seemed reasonably stable -- and at that point, \nI just wanted to use 3.0, so I did.\n\nJulian\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n"}
