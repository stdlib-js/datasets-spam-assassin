I've been running a week's worth of \nmaillog relay= IPs through rbcheck every Sunday.  Found quite a few. \nI should break up the list and run multiple rbcheck instances.  Just \nhaven't gotten there yet though.  I think I'll have either MIMEDefang \nor Procmail keep a copy of messages over a certain score for daily \nrazor-reporting.  I could just let SA do it too I suppose.\n\nSay, maybe you can tell me what I'm doing wrong in SA.  I added \nreport_header 1 to my \n/etc/mail/mimedefang/spamassassin/sa-mimedefang.cf but it didn't \nappear to change anything.  I bounced over another copy of spam to my \nspamtrap and it still created the SPAM: attachment.  sa-mimedefang.cf \nhas this in it now:\n\nrequired_hits           1\nauto_report_threshold   100\nok_locales              en\nrewrite_subject 0\nreport_header 1\nuse_terse_report 1\ndefang_mime 0\nskip_rbl_checks 1\n\nI can't figure out if that was the write cf to modify or not.  I also \nhave a /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf but it's empty.  I think I \nmight be taking too many bites out of too many pies at once. :-)  The \nrequired_hits changes I made to sa-mimedefang.cf seem to have worked. \nI don't know why the report_header change didn't though.  Any ideas?\n\nJustin\n-- \n\n--\nJustin Shore, ES-SS ES-SSR      Pittsburg State University\nNetwork & Systems Manager       Kelce 157Q\nOffice of Information Systems   Pittsburg, KS 66762\nVoice: (620) 235-4606           Fax: (620) 235-4545\nhttp://www.pittstate.edu/ois/\n\nWarning:  This message has been quadruple Rot13'ed for your protection.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board\nfor high-tech professionals.
