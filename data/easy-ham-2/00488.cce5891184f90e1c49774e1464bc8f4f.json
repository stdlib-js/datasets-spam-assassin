It's\ncertainly not involved in the regular resolution process. It may\nbe involved in zone distribution as you suggest. IIRC (and I often\ndon't) on Friday ns0 had a serial that none of the IE nameservers \nshared. Unfortunately I don't have a record of that.\n\n> This whole thing does seriously bring into question IEDR's decision to\n> outsource the technical admininstration of .ie to a company that\n> apparently does not even admin its own DNS.

So IE had\ntwo dead nameservers, four stuck a week in the past and three\nworking correctly. Marvellous.\n\n\nATB,\njames\n_______________________________________________\nIIU mailing list\nIIU@iiu.taint.org\nhttp://iiu.taint.org/mailman/listinfo/iiu\n\n\n"}
