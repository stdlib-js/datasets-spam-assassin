:) or do you mean that somehow \n> floyd is the new foo, (foo is dead, all hail floyd) and that bar now \n> points to floyd?\n\nyes.  i did fail to mention that floyd might not use inode 111, but\nit might.  and that was my point, having these mythical symlinks point\nto the device+inode is not simple.  just like the unrm thing, it might\nbe possible, but hard links and soft links are the best implementations\nthat have survived to date on unix.  windows shortcuts are kinda weird -\nthey're really an application level thing.\n\nmac aliases seem to take the idea of unix symlinks (linking by filename)\nalong with the concept of device+inode.  i don't know mac internals,\nbut i seem to remember being told it tried the former first, and then\ntried the latter.  how it would deal with the 2nd example i mentioned i\ndunno - i'm not certain if the mac version of inodes would suffer from\nthat (maybe the fs identifier for the file included the creation time\nor something like that).\n\n> how do i control this 'symlinks magically link to new files' feature?\n\ni think it would be difficult.  it would also fail to work in numerous\nsituations.\n\nkevin\n\n-- \nkevin@suberic.net     that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to\nfork()'ed on 37058400    the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier\nmeatspace place: home       than a sober one. the happiness of credulity is a\nhttp://ie.suberic.net/~kevin   cheap & dangerous quality -- g.b. shaw\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
