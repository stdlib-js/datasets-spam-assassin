Feedback, notes and comments\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nCOCKLES OF ONE'S HEART  You may recall that I was a bit suspicious\nof the story I told in last week's issue. James Woodfield pointed\nout that there is another possible explanation. In medieval Latin,\nthe ventricles of the heart were at times called \"cochleae cordis\",\nwhere the second word is derived from \"cor\", heart. Those unversed\nin Latin could have misinterpreted \"cochleae\" as \"cockles\". Oddly,\n\"cochlea\" in Latin means \"snail\" (from the shape of the ventricles\n- it's also the name of the spiral cavity of the inner ear), so if\nthis story is right we should really be speaking of warming the\nsnails of one's heart.\n\nSERRANCIFIED  Many of you supplied your own memories of this odd\nexpression that I tried to make sense of last week. Taken together,\nthey show that the expression is best known in Canada and that it\nwas originally something like \"My sufficiency has been suffonsified\nand anything additional would be superfluous\". That form of the\nword is the one that is most common in online searches, where the\nCanadian focus is also obvious. Cheryl Caesar noted that it appears\nin a passage in Margaret Atwood's novel, \"Cat's Eye\": she has two\nteenage girls living in Toronto in the 1940s who say, \"Are you\nsufficiently sophonisified?\". A Vancouver restaurant reviewer has\nthe pen name \"Sufficiently Suffonsified\". Oddly, there's also a\n1999 record by the Austrian band Cunning Dorx entitled \"Paradigms\nSuffonsified\". G H Gordon Paterson suggested that the word might be\na punning blend of \"sufficient\" and \"fancified\". There are some\ntantalising suggestions that it may actually be Scots, and not New\nWorld at all.\n\nABSQUATULATE  I have been gently remonstrated with for describing\n\"sockdologer\" as one of the products of early American linguistic\ninventiveness that hasn't survived to the present day. Many people\ngave me examples of current or recent use. I stand corrected.\n\n\n2. Turns of Phrase: Thinspiration\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is one of the key words associated with a deeply disquieting\nonline trend. In the past couple of years or so a number of Web\nsites and chatrooms have appeared which actively promote anorexia\nnervosa (known on the sites as \"ana\") and other eating disorders as\nlifestyle choices. Since 90% of anorexics are young women, these\n\"pro-ana\" sites are usually run by and attract that group (one term\nsometimes used for them is \"weborexics\"). Sites offer suggestions\non how to become and remain thin, often through tips on avoiding\neating, and how to disguise the condition from family and friends.\nOther themes sometimes featured on such sites are self-mutilation\n(\"cutting\") and bulimia (\"mia\"). Thin women, such as supermodels\nand Calista Flockhart, are presented as \"thinspirations\", examples\nto emulate. Sites have had names such as Starving for Perfection,\nWasting Away on the Web and Dying To Be Thin. Medical professionals\nin the US and UK are deeply concerned about them, because they\naccentuate the low self-regard of young women, who are particularly\nprone to eating disorders, put their lives at risk, and discourage\nthem from facing their illness and seeking treatment for it.\n\nThe Internet is home to a number of pro-eating disorder Web sites -\n- places where sufferers can discuss tips, trade low-calorie\nrecipes and exchange poems and art that may be used as \"triggers\"\nor so-called \"thinspiration.\"\n                                         [\"Calgary Sun\", Feb. 2002]\n\nA new trend among young adults has been sweeping the nation: pro-\nanorexia Web sites. Also known as pro-ana, these sites glorify\nanorexia nervosa and offer \"thinspiration\" on maintaining a\nstarvation lifestyle.\n                                     [\"University Wire\", Apr. 2002]\n\n\n3. Weird Words: Usufructuary  /ju:zjU'frVktju:@rI/\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nA person who has the use or enjoyment of something, especially\nproperty.\n\nWe are short of words that contain four u's. Among the few that are\neven relatively common (leaving aside the Hawaiian \"muu-muu\") are\n\"tumultuously\" and \"unscrupulous\", although some rare words like\n\"pustulocrustaceous\" and \"pseudotuberculous\" are also recorded.\n\nThe term comes from Roman law. \"Usufruct\" is the right of temporary\npossession or enjoyment of something that belongs to somebody else,\nso far as that can be done without causing damage or changing its\nsubstance. For example, a slave in classical Rome could not own\nanything. Things he acquired as the result of his labour he merely\nheld \"usus (et) fructus\", under \"use (and) enjoyment\" - it was his\nmaster who actually owned them.\n\nThe term remains in use in modern US legal practice and elsewhere.\nThese days a \"usufructuary\" can be a trustee who enjoys the income\nfrom property he holds in trust for somebody else. Many Native\nAmerican groups hold land on a \"usufruct\" basis, with rights to\nenjoy the renewable natural resources of the land for hunting and\nfishing.\n\n\n4. Q&A\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ. How does the term \"three sheets to the wind\" denote drunkenness?\n[Benjamin Weatherston]\n\nA. It's a sailor's expression.\n\nWe ignorant landlubbers might think that a sheet is a sail, but in\ntraditional sailing-ship days, a \"sheet\" was actually a rope,\nparticularly one attached to the bottom corner of a sail (it comes\nfrom an Old English term for the corner of a sail). The sheets were\nvital, since they trimmed the sail to the wind. If they ran loose,\nthe sail would flutter about in the wind and the ship would wallow\noff its course out of control.\n\nExtend this idea to sailors on shore leave, staggering back to the\nship after a good night on the town, well tanked up. The irregular\nand uncertain locomotion of the jolly seafarers must have reminded\nonlookers of the way a ship moved in which the sheets were loose.\nPerhaps one loose sheet might not have been enough to get the image\nacross, so the saying became \"three sheets to the wind\".\n\nOur first written example comes from that recorder of low life,\nPierce Egan, in his \"Real life in London\" of 1821. But it must\nsurely be much older.\n\n                        -----------\n\nQ. My East End mother-in-law used to say she was \"well and truly\nmogadored\" when she was puzzled by something. Any idea of\nderivation and meaning? [Bryan]\n\nA. Now that's a bit of British slang I haven't heard in years,\nthough it is still around (Nanny Ogg uses it in one of Terry\nPratchett's Discworld fantasy stories, I am told). As you say, it\nmeans that somebody is puzzled, confused, or \"all at sea\". It's\nalso sometimes spelled \"moggadored\", though it doesn't turn up in\nprint much in either spelling. (No relation to the British word\n\"moggy\" for a cat, by the way, which seems to be a pet form of\n\"Margaret\".)\n\nThe writers of slang dictionaries are decidedly mogadored about its\norigin. It looks very much like rhyming slang for \"floored\", which\nis likewise slang, meaning dumbfounded or confused. But the dispute\narises over what the root is. Some say it is Irish, from \"magagh\",\nto mock, jeer or laugh at, via an unrecorded intermediate form\n\"mogad�i\".\n\nOthers suggest that, like some other East End slang terms, it\nderives from the Gypsy language Romany (Cockney slang is like\nLondon itself, a melting pot, in which words from many sources are\namalgamated, including Yiddish and old-time forces slang derived\nfrom languages around the world). In this case the source may be\n\"mokardi\" or \"mokodo\", something tainted (these Romany words also\nprovide the root for yet another slang phrase, \"to put the mockers\non something\", to jinx it).\n\nSorry not to be able to be more definite!\n\n                        -----------\n\nQ. I was having an interesting discussion with an American\nprofessor of business studies who also consults to industry. She\nwas recalling an unbudgeted initiative within a major software\ncorporate, which the UK managing director described as a \"skunk\nproject\". I have seen this epithet before, usually in the phrase\n\"skunk works\", meaning a semi-official project team that is tacitly\nlicensed to bend the rules and think outside the box. I wonder what\nthe derivation is? I don't think it can refer to the smelly wild\nanimal, but neither I think can it refer to the street term for a\nstrong variant of marijuana. Can you shed any light? [Martin\nHayman]\n\nA. We must start in Dogpatch, the fictional place in the backwoods\nof upper New York State made famous between 1934 and 1977 as the\nhome of professional mattress tester Li'l Abner, in the comic strip\nwritten and drawn by Al Capp. The original was actually \"Skonk\nWorks\", the place where Lonesome Polecat and Hairless Joe brewed\ntheir highly illicit bootleg Kickapoo Joy Juice from ingredients\nsuch as old shoes and dead skunks. (\"Skonk\" is a dialect variant of\n\"skunk\".)\n\nWe must now move to the very real Burbank, California. In 1943, a\nsmall group of aeronautical engineers working for the then Lockheed\nAircraft Corporation (headed by Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson) were\ngiven the rush job of creating an entirely new plane from scratch,\nthe P-80 \"Shooting Star\" jet fighter. This they did in 143 days, 37\ndays ahead of schedule. Their secret project was housed in a\ntemporary structure roofed over with an old circus tent, which had\nbeen thrown up next to a smelly plastics factory. The story goes\nthat one of the engineers answered the phone on a hot summer day\nwith the phrase \"Skonk Works here\" and the name stuck. It is also\nsaid that Al Capp objected to their use of his term and it was\nchanged to Skunk Works.\n\nOne division of the company, formally the Lockheed Martin Advanced\nDevelopment Program, is still known as the Skunk Works. The term\nhas been trademarked by Lockheed Martin, who have been aggressive\nin protecting it.\n\nAs a generic term, it dates from the 1960s. One definition is very\nmuch that of the original and the one you describe: a small group\nof experts who drop out of the mainstream of a company's operations\nin order to develop some experimental technology or new application\nin secrecy or at speed, unhampered by bureaucracy or the strict\napplication of regulations (Kelly Johnson formulated 14 visionary\nrules for running such an operation, which are still regarded as\nvalid even now). It is also sometimes used for a similar group that\noperates semi-illicitly, without top-level official knowledge or\nsupport, though usually with the tacit approval of immediate\nmanagement.\n\n\n5.
