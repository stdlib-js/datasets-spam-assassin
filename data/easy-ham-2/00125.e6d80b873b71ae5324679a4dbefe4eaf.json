Squid, and most other good http proxies won't let you connect\nto any other destination port other than 443 (by default).  So the sshd \nhas to be listening on port 443. PuTTy's proxy support is a bit flaky \nright now, the raw connects are a bit flaky aswell, I can't get them \nto work with certain revisions of IOS becuase they use different prompts\nand success strings, gah! I havnt played with the SOCKS proxy support\nmuch yet, but it's there.\n\nIf you're trying to SSH through a http proxy, use netcat :)\nPuTTy's proxy stuff will take another few weeks to get stable, and\ncurrently it won't send keepalives, so if you go afk expect your \nsession to get killed by the proxy.  Netcat send keepalives\nwhich prevent this :)\n\n# \n# call as http_proxy_tunnel host port\n#\nfunction http_proxy_tunnel()\n{\n\tmkfifo in.fifo\n\n\t( echo CONNECT $1:$2 HTTP/1.1 \n          echo HOST: $1:$2\n          echo HTTP/1.1\n\t  echo \n          cat in.fifo ) | nc myproxy 3128 | (read ; read ; nc -lp <localport> > in.fifo )\n}\n\n\ncourse that assumes you have bash, I use cygwin, but the above should be\ndoable natively, then again if you have cygwin, use OpenSSH and it's\nexcellently configurable proxycmd :)\n\n-- \ncolmmacc@redbrick.dcu.ie        PubKey: colmmacc+pgp@redbrick.dcu.ie  \nWeb:                                 http://devnull.redbrick.dcu.ie/ \n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
