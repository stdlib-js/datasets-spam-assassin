Assuming a\n2km-wide --- that is, 20 000 decimeter-wide --- spherical asteroid of\nspecific gravity 10, 4/3 pi r^3 says it would have a volume of 4e12\ncubic decimeters and thus a mass of 4e13 kg.  The force we'd have to\napply to achieve this acceleration would be roughly equivalent to the\nweight of 200 kg here on Earth.\n\nSo, yeah, ion drives are probably a no-go, unless I screwed up the\ncalculations here; I think the force they typically exert is about\nfour orders of magnitude too small.\n\nIf we just wanted to hit today it with enough of an impulse that it\nwould miss us 17 years later, we'd need to accelerate it by about 1.1\ncm/s.  A one-ton (1000kg) mass would need to hit it at about 4e9 m/s,\nor about ten times the speed of light, to achieve this, so that's not\npossible.  (If you could actually put enough work into a one-ton mass,\nas it approached the speed of light, it would mass more, so you could\nstill do it with a one-ton mass; but we don't have anything\napproaching that speed.)  The impulse required is inversely\nproportional to the remaining time to impact, so if we were to hit it\nafter half the time has elapsed, we'd need to accelerate it by around\n2.2 cm/s instead.\n\nThe gravitational force of an Earth-sized mass could provide\nsufficient deflection if that mass were about 4.5e5 times as far away\nfrom the asteroid as we are from Earth's center, or about 2.7e9 m, or\nabout 0.018 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun (0.018 AU).\n(And if that mass stayed so nearby for 17 years.)\n\nThe effects of continuous acceleration benefit greatly from planning\nahead, since they scale with t^2, not t --- and thus the needed\nacceleration scales with 1/t^2.  After half the time has elapsed, we'd\nneed four times as much acceleration to make it miss the Earth than if\nwe were to start accelerating it now.\n\nAll of these numbers are a little low, because the Earth presents a\nslightly easier target than its physical size suggests, due to its\ngravity well.  How much easier depends on the speed of the projectile\nin ways I don't understand.\n\nThey're also a little high, because they assume the force is being\napplied purely at right angles to the asteroid's current path, which\nis a slightly suboptimal scenario (although for velocity changes five\norders of magnitude smaller than the relative velocity, the difference\nis probably insignificant.)  And they assume there are no other effects on the asteroid's path.\n\nWhat about electrical charges?  Could we electrically charge the\nasteroid and another nearby asteroid, perhaps with electron beams, to\nprovide the needed acceleration?\n\nOf course, all of this calculation could be applied in the other\ndirection, too.  If you want to sock a moon colony with a one-ton\nasteroid, you could do it with a tiny amount of force applied over\ntwenty-five years to adjust its orbit.\n\n***\n\nAbout spam: I'm sorry to admit I haven't implemented any of the better\nsolutions, and so I'm afraid I'll have to allow non-subscriber FoRK\nmail to be detained for scanning.  I hope this measure can be reversed\nsoon when I have time to implement better measures.  As has often been\nnoted by other posters, measures to reduce spam sent to the FoRK list\nwill not significantly decrease the spam load of FoRKposters, since\nthe vast majority of spam received by FoRKposters is sent to them\ndirectly, not through the FoRK list.\n\n-- \n<kragen@pobox.com>       Kragen Sitaker     <http://www.pobox.com/~kragen/>\nSilence may not be golden, but at least it's quiet.
