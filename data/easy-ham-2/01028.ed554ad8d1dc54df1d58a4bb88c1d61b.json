Analysts\nboth favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them from\nthese standpoints, while paying much less attention to what\nthe proposals imply from the standpoint of what content\ncontrol itself really means.\n\nThe most significant problem with TCPA and Palladium is not\nwhether they may interfere with the power of the universal\nlogic device, or whether they are effectual from the\nstandpoint of privacy and security concerns, though these\nare all very important concerns.  Rather, the fundamental\nproblem they present is in the political premises that they\nhope to implement for the sake of the \"content industries.\"\n\nTCPA and Palladium are the technological realization of the\nconcepts embodied in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms\nTreaty (WPPT), which only came into effect this past May\n20th (with little public notice or fanfare, of course).  The\nWPPT declares an unprecedented \"moral right\" of authors to\ncontrol public uses of their works.\n\n*That's* the real game plan.\n\nTCPA and Palladium are simply content control for the\nmasses.  They constitute an effort to \"democratize\" content\ncontrol under the concept of \"moral rights,\" encouraging the\npublic to overlook the clear public interest issues raised\nby the specter of content control, and to confuse these\nissues with private interest issues such as privacy and\nsecurity.  They are an effort to get the public to jump on\nthe bandwagon without adequate consideration of what's\nreally on the line.\n\nIn America, we have never supported the concept of \"moral\nrights\" which the WPPT professes.  The US Constitution\naccords Congress the power to grant (or deny) exclusive\nrights to works and inventions for the purpose of promoting\nthe progress of the useful arts and sciences, not for the\npurpose of rewarding the originality of creators -- though\nthat result is obviously a consequence of exclusive rights\nstatutes such as copyright law.  Our Supreme Court\nexplicitly articulates this distinction, and for very good\nreason.  In America, we implicitly understand the\ndistinction between expression, the aspect of works to which\ncopyright statute applies, and the facts and ideas that make\nup a work, to which it does *not* apply.\n\nThe reason for this is essential and unavoidable, and must\nbe stated clearly and unequivocally at this juncture:\ninformation is free.  It's not that it *wants* to be -- it\n*is* and it always has been.  This fact is unassailable,\nhowever, unless we let come to pass a world that subscribes\nto \"universal content control\" for the sake of so-called\n\"moral rights\" implemented at the behest of narrow content\nindustry interests.\n\nTCPA and Palladium are initiatives that hope to encourage\nthe general public, and more specifically producers of\ninformation products in general, to identify content control\nwith \"moral rights,\" blithely overlooking the real\nimplications of information technology in a free society,\nand the long tradition of American jurisprudence upholding\nthe freedom intrinsic to information, a freedom on which the\nprospects of information technology crucially depend.\n\nSeth Johnson\n\n-- \n\n[CC] Counter-copyright:\nhttp://cyber.law.harvard.edu/cc/cc.html\n\nI reserve no rights restricting copying, modification or\ndistribution of this incidentally recorded communication. \nOriginal authorship should be attributed reasonably, but\nonly so far as such an expectation might hold for usual\npractice in ordinary social discourse to which one holds no\nclaim of exclusive rights.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
