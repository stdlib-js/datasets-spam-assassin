The pieces of interest\nare the papers by Prof. Robert Clark, who perhaps might not be a bad choice of\nspeaker for some future LUG gathering. One of the more eye-opening comments in\nthe second of his papers is that Irish legislation is, in effect, more\ndraconian than the DMCA.\n\nhttp://www.cai.ie/Past%20Events.html#2002\n\nThere are some other interesting pieces here, too, for anyone concerned about\ncopyright and the like in Ireland.\n\nCheers,\nWaider.
