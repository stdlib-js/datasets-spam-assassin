For that matter, somebody with a Win32 system\ncontaining such a card might be ecstatic over the opportunity to swap.\n\n(3) Welcome to the Linux world, where we've known for... oh... about\neleven years that you fail to research chipsets before installation at\nyour peril.\n\n-- \nCheers,   The difference between common sense and paranoia is that common sense\nRick Moen     is thinking everyone is out to get you.
