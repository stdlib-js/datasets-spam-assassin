Let's go back tae mah place.\"\n\nSo they go back to her place and have great sex. Afterwards, Sean  says,\n\"If you think that was good, let me shleep for half an hour, and we can\nhave even better shex. But while I'm shleeping, hold my baws in your\nleft hand and my wullie in your right hand.\"\n\nLulu looks a bit perplexed, but says, \"Okay.\"\n\nHe sleeps for half and hour, awakens, and they have even better sex.\nThen Sean says, \"Lulu,  that was wonderful.

But again, hold my baws\nin your left hand, and my wullie in your right hand.\"\n\nLulu is now used to the routine and  complies.\n\nThe results are mind blowing.
