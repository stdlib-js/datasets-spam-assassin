Purchases PGP Desktop Encryption and Wireless Product\nLines from NET\n\nAugust 19, 2002\n\n\nDear Customer,\n\nToday we are pleased to announce that PGP Corporation, a newly formed,\nventure-funded security company, has acquired the PGP desktop encryption\nand wireless product lines from Network Associates.  As you know, prior to\nplacing the products into maintenance mode, we were actively looking for a\nbuyer that would continue the development and support of the technology.\n\nNetwork Associates has retained products developed using PGPsdk including\nMcAfee E-Business Server for encrypted server-to-server file transfer,\nMcAfee Desktop Firewall and McAfee VPN Client. These products will remain a\npart of Network Associatesï¿½ existing product portfolio and we will continue\nto develop them to meet your security needs. PGP Corporation has acquired\nPGPmail, PGPfile, PGPdisk, PGPwireless, PGPadmin and PGPkeyserver\nencryption software products for Win32 and Macintosh, PGPsdk encryption\nsoftware development kit, and PGP Corporate Desktop for Macintosh.\n\nIn addition to the technology, PGP Corporation has acquired all worldwide\ncustomer license agreements and technical support obligations. To ensure a\nseamless transition, Network Associates will work with PGP Corporation to\nsupport PGP customers through October 26, 2002. PGP Corporation will\ncontact you shortly with details on its plans and product direction.\n\nWe trust that you will have continued success with the PGP desktop and\nwireless encryption products through PGP Corporation. Network Associates\nappreciates your business and we value our continued relationship across\nour remaining product lines.\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nSandra England\nExecutive Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Research\nNetwork Associates\n\n\n\n****************************************************************************************************\nYou have received this message because you are a subscriber to the Network\nAssociates Web sites.
