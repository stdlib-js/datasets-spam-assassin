Learn to love\ngconf-editor ;) -- metacity can have sloppy focus (Desktop Preferences\n-> Window Focus -- there's actually GUI for that), and the delay until\nraising (and whether it raises) can be set in gconf-editor,\n/apps/metacity/general/auto_raise and auto_raise_delay\n\n> - I like the ability to have sliding panels that auto-hide in GNOME... but\n> with the new panel you can't specify the amount of pixels by which it\n> sticks out anymore :-(\n\n/apps/panel/global/panel_minimized_size\n\n> \n> These are only two examples, I could find more : Each time I use GNOME 2\n> I'm quickly irritated by a little something that suited me better in 1.4.\n\nWell, it definitely is not the same as 1.4. Some people will always like\ngnome 1 better. Whatever suits your needs.\n\n> I'm not saying that GNOME 2 is bad, poorly conceived or ugly.

The\nGNOME team decided that advanced users who want to edit the kinds of\noptions you talk about are advanced enough to use gconf-editor.\nPersonally, I'm fine with that, because I don't find gconf-editor hard\nto use :)\n\nJulian\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
