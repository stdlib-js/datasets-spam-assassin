I also have more than one computer therefore I need a router\nso that I can connect them together.\nThe 2 options I am looking at are : \n  the ADSL usb modem connected to my linux machine, with the linux\n\tmachine acting as firewall; and\n  a combined router / firewall box which would be connected directly\n\tto the ADSL modem.\n\nSo my questions are : \n\twhat recommendations would any of you have about the above ?\n\tdo I need to have NAT (I have only a vague idea of what this does )?\n\twhat other options should I be looking at ?\n\nThanks\nCon\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
