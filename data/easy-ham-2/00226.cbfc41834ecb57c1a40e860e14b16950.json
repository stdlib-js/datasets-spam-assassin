There is a lot of support, mailing lists, web sites, etc that\nwill help people decide if Linux is going to like a box or not, use them.\n\n> (without a net connection/56k modem).

The products that any company sell with linux installed will be\neasily reinstalled with linux. The products sold with Windows only may not\nbe. Having said that I've never found a Dell system it was impossible to put\nRH on. I have had one or two headaches in the past doing it, though.\n\nsteve\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
