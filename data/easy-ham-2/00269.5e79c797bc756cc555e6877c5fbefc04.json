Then again, boot floppies are cheaper, and easier to recreate \nwhen you'd like to do some changes to it. Gets messier when you'd have a \nboot image on a server, and the only way you can test it is to boot it over \nthe network. In any case, it's just one option available.\n\n>  AMD were talking of supporting it ages back, when the Athlon was looking\n>like it would just be on workstations from day one.

I do like the OpenBoot idea actually. Especially being \nable to set the PROM to boot from whatever disk slice you'd want. No need \nto set that in lilo/grub any more in that case, since the OpenBoot rom \ntakes care of that part for you. Then again, you wouldn't get a menu that \nallows you to choose what you want to boot. There's good and bad, all \ndepending on what you want to do, I suppose. Sitting here and typing I'm \nrealising that it is both a nice thing, and a nasty thing..\n\nAh well, life sucks as well, some say.. ;)\n\n//Anders//\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
