The Apple UFS implementation performs like a dog, was frozen in 97,\nimplemented badly and has not been updated since. HFS+ get's tweaked every\nnow and then, but enough screaming has them looking at shoving UFS2 in there\nsomewhere down the road. )\n\nThen there's the holdover NeXT inherent weirdness, such as multiple versions\nof common Unix files, but none of them do anything, and all changes you\nwould usually append to them have to go through NetInfo Manager.\n\nAll in all, I find it to be a functional, if not overly quirky desktop\nenvironment.\n\nAs for your initial question,\nhttp://www.omnigroup.com/developer/mailinglists/\n\nRegards,\nMark.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
