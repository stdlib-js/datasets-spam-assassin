His crime: writing code that exposed flaws in Adobe's\n         e-book security, in contravention of the USA's exciting new\n         DMCA. In the next year, thanks to widespread protests, Adobe\n         withdrew their call to prosecute the Russian hacker and\n         Dmitry was freed. Elcomsoft is still in the dock for\n         breaching Adobe's copy restriction routines. If the aim of\n         the prosecution was to cow them into keeping quiet about\n         security problems, it doesn't appear to have worked. On July\n         12th, 2002, ELCOMSOFT posted to Bugtraq a flaw in Adobe's\n         e-book security. Namely, that in Adobe's \"lending library\"\n         web app for the Adobe Content Server, you can borrow a book\n         for over twenty years (instead of three days) just by\n         changing a hidden Web form value. The library site is just a\n         demonstration app, so it's not a serious problem, but it\n         does give Elcomsoft room for a catty little addendum. \"Some\n         time ago\", they write \"we have found much more serious\n         problem with another Adobe software and reported it to the\n         vendor; however, there was no response at all, and so we\n         decided not to waste our time reporting this one (about the\n         library) to Adobe\". How much reaction do they want?\n         Salt sown in the soil of Moscow and the Volga canal aflame?\n         http://lists.insecure.org/bugtraq/2002/Jul/0133.html\n                           - don't plan any trips to Disneyland, Vlad\n         http://librarydemo.adobe.com/library/\n                          - fixed, it looks, by stubbing out the code\n         http://lists.insecure.org/bugtraq/2002/Jul/0193.html\n- now, for real chutzpah, post a Symantec exploit on the newly 0wn3d BugTraq\n\n         We'll tread cautiously with this one, as it involves Vast\n         Ageless Corporations Who Have Retained Counsel Living Where\n         Their Glowing Eyesockets Used To Be. Just days before we\n         read on Slashdot that zombie company FORGENT is demanding\n         patent license fees for users of JPEG, we're contacted by\n         someone who has received a similiarly threatening letter -\n         this time, from the rather more established Lucent\n         Technologies. The message reads: \"After some market research\n         it has come to our attention that some of your company's\n         products may employ the JBIG/JPEG Standard. Therefore,\n         Lucent Technologies GRL LLC, Lucent's licensing agent, is\n         contacting your company regarding your interest in obtaining\n         a license for patents.\" What follows is the usual demand for\n         fees, dire threats if compliance is thwarted, requests that\n         the guards seize the criminals and throw them in Patent\n         Dungeon, etc. Now, Lucent's patents don't seem to be\n         breached by a JPEG implementaton (although it's known that\n         JBIG is patent-encumbered; hence JBIG-2). So why does Lucent\n         bring up JPEG at all? A curious wording for sure, and we'd\n         be interested to see if anyone else has been contacted in\n         these terms.

Merely \n         appearing in the list seems to have prompted the reclusive,\n         unsmiling, and often violent comedian to hurredly post a \n         TVGoHome update from his pile of cardboard boxes near Soho,\n         which is all to the good. But does he really deserve the title?\n         What *is* sharpness? \"In case your are [sic] in any doubt\", \n         the site explains, \"sharpness is, above all, an attitude\". Now\n         the dictionary says it's also \"having a bitter taste\", and\n         \"harshness of manner\", and given that Hank, the Angry\n         Drunken Dwarf is both unlisted and dead, we think Brooker's\n         a show-in for the Web protest/mess-with-publisher's-heads\n         vote.
