As hard as you\ntry, you cannot piece together your return journey from the pub to\nyour house. The answer to this puzzle is that you used a Beer\nScooter.\n\nThe Beer Scooter is a mythical form of transport, owned and leased\nto the drunk by Bacchus the Roman god of wine. Bacchus has branched\nout since the decrease in the worship of the Roman Pantheon and\nhas bought a large batch of these magical devices. The Beer Scooter\nworks in the following fashion:-\n\nThe passenger reaches a certain level of drunkenness and the\n\"slurring gland\" begins to give off a pheromone. Bacchus or one of\nhis many sub-contractors detects this pheromone and sends down a\nwinged Beer Scooter. The scooter scoops up the passenger and deposits\nthem in their bedroom via the Trans-Dimensional Portal. This is\nnot cheap to run, so a large portion of the passenger's in-pocket\ncash is taken as payment.\n\nThis answers the second question after a night out 'How did I spend\nso much money?'\n\nUnfortunately, Beer Scooters have a poor safety record and are\nthought to be responsible for over 90% of all UDI (Unidentified\nDrinking Injuries).  An undocumented feature of the beer scooter\nis the destruction of time segments during the trip. The nature of\nTrans-Dimensional Portals dictates that time will be lost, seemingly\nunaccounted for.\n\nThis answers a third question after a night out 'What the hell\nhappened?'\n\nWith good intentions, Bacchus opted for the REMIT (Removal of\nEmbarrassing Moments In Time) add on, that automatically removes,\nin descending order, those parts in time regretted most. Unfortunately\none person's REMIT is not necessarily the REMIT of another and\nquite often lost time is regained in discussions over a period of\ntime. Independent studies have also shown that Beer Goggles often\ncause the scooter's navigation system to malfunction thus sending\nthe passenger to the wrong bedroom, often with horrific consequences.\nWith recent models including a GPS, Bacchus made an investment in\na scooter drive-thru chain specialising in half eaten kebabs and\npizza crusts.\n\nAnother question answered!! For the family man, Beer Scooters come\nequipped with flowers picked from other people's garden and\nThump-A-Lot boots (Patent Pending). These boots are designed in\nsuch a way that no matter how quietly you tip-toe up the stairs,\nyou are sure to wake up your other half. Special anti-gravity\nsprings ensure that you bump into every wall in the house and the\nCTSGS (Coffee Table Seeking Guidance System) explains the bruised\nshins. The final add-on Bacchus saw fit to invest in for some\nscooters is the TAS (Tobacco Absorption System). This explains how\none person can apparently get through 260 Marlboro Lights in a\nsingle night.\n\nPS: Don't forget the on-board heater, which allows you to comfortably\nget home from the pub in sub-zero temperatures, wearing just a\nT-shirt.\n\n\n"}
