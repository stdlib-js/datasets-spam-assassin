The\n   flaws presented in this paper are, at the time of writing,\n   unfixable. The only reliable solution to these attacks requires\n   functionality that is not present in Windows, as well as efforts on\n   the part of every single Windows software vendor. Microsoft has\n   known about these flaws for some time; when I alerted them to this\n   attack, their response was that they do not class it as a flaw -\n   the email can be found here. This research was sparked by comments\n   made by Microsoft VP Jim Allchin who stated, under oath, that there\n   were flaws in Windows so great that they would threaten national\n   security if the Windows source code were to be disclosed. He\n   mentioned Message Queueing, and immediately regretted it. However,\n   given the quantity of research currently taking place around the\n   world after Mr Allchin's comments, it is about time the white hat\n   community saw what is actually possible.\n\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\nBusiness Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com\n\"Computers are useless.
