Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not \nexactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.\n\nJust try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) \nCanada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own \n\"Permit Rajs\" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more \nsocialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).\n\nYet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as \nwell as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the \nexecutives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment \ncommunity for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They \nfinished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off \nhundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.\n\nSo.. tell me again.. how are we better off?\n\n-Ian.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, August 20, 2002, at 12:09 PM, John Hall wrote:\n\nThe Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails\nEverywhere Else -- by Hernando De Soto\t\n\nIs something I'm reading now.\n\nMy impression is that France is not anywhere near the \"Permit Raj\"\nnightmare that India is (and became).  Nor has its market been closed\nlike India's has.\n\nBut De Soto's work is perhaps just as important or more so.  He hasn't\ndealt specifically with India, but I recall examples from Peru,\nPhilippines, and Egypt.  In Lima, his team took over a year (I think it\nwas 2) working 8 hr days to legally register a 1 person company.  In the\nPhilippines, getting legal title can take 20 years.  In Egypt, about 80%\nof the population in Cairo lives in places where they are officially\nillegal.\n\nIndia hasn't been helped by its socialism.  Socialism has certainly\nhelped strangle the country in permits.  But perhaps De Soto is right\nthat the real crippling thing is keeping most of the people out of the\nlegal, official property system.\n\nPutting most of the people in the property system was something the west\nonly finished about 100 years ago, or Japan did 50 years ago.  It wasn't\neasy, but we live in a society that doesn't even remember we did it.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nRobert\nHarley\nSent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:24 AM\nTo: fork@spamassassin.taint.org\nSubject: Re: The Curse of India's Socialism\n\nRAH quoted:\nIndians are not poor because there are too many of them; they are\npoor\nbecause there are too many regulations and too much government\nintervention\n-- even today, a decade after reforms were begun.
