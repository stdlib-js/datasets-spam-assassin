My legs should be\narriving in Moscow any time now. All my feathers have been processed and are\nnow being eaten by cattle somewhere in Texas. My blood and bones have been\nrendered for cat food, fertilizer and who-knows- what else. My wings have\nbeen seasoned with barbecue sauce and served with a side of ranch dressing\nand celery at some bar and grill in New York City. My feet? Well, they're\nheaded to Asia where I'm told they're something of a delicacy.\n\n-----------\n\nSo, a couple of things intrigued me about this byline, and its associated\nmain article:\nAnd On the 47th Day, This Chicken Went to Market\nBy  Debbie Gage\nhttp://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,3959,367672,00.asp\n\n- I had no idea how much computer controls played into the raising of\nlivestock\n- I had no idea how fast a chicken is raised these days\n\nIt also strikes me that it will not be very long before livestock is\ngenetically engineered to be dumber and meatier, and better adapted to\nliving in industrial conditions.\n\n- Jim\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
