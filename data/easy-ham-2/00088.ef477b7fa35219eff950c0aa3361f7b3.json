One annoyance of eBay is that many sellers state \"will\nship to US only\".  However, I've found that if you ask nicely, they will\nusually ship over here.  For payments, either setup a paypal account or\npost the seller a US dollar bank draft.  I've got lots of little bits and\npieces that way (for example, finally got my hands on a rackmount kit for\nmy DECserver 700 terminal server which I'd been looking for for ages, for\na total of US$15).\n\nLater,\nKenn\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
