I use procmail to filter\ndifferent incomgin To/CCs to different folders then use folder hok, but\nthis looks closer to what you want.\n\n\nhttp://www.linuxcare.com/viewpoints/ap-of-the-wk/03-31-00.epl\n\n**************************************************************************\nSome of the mailto links on our web site forward to me. When I reply to\nsomeone who writes to one of these aliases, I prefer to keep the mail alias\nas the From: address in my reply. For example, when someone sends email to\ncoolapps@linuxcare.com to suggest a program for me to review [pardon the\nblatant plug...], it forwards to me. When I hit reply, the From: line in\nthe email will contain coolapps@linuxcare.com instead of my main address\nbneely@linuxcare.com. My .muttrc file accomplishes this with two lines:\n\nset alternates = \"kbeditor@linuxcare.com|coolapps@linuxcare.com\"\nset reverse_name\n\n**************************************************************************\n\nOn Tue, 30 Jul 2002, David Neary wrote:\n\n> I have 3 or 4 email addresses (which get used for different\n> reasons), and I'd prefer not to mix them up.
