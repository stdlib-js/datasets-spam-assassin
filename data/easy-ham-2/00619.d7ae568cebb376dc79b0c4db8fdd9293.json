My guess is if 1% \nof razor users can reach this limit (or be near enough), spammers won't \nbe able to cheat just by building up their trust, they would need a fair \namount of fake users too.\n\nNow, for the \"fair amount of fake users\", spammers don't have access to \nmany set of network classes. So they would need a bunch of users coming \nfrom the same set of ips. If the razor servers see 100 people on a class \nC network (253 ips) reporting 10000 emails a day, something wrong is \ngoing on. This could also trigger alarms.\n\nAs for legitimate proxies and the like, 1) a proxy should not report any\nthing (spam should be reported by hand, not automatically), 2) there may \nbe a way to have exception (IBM networks would have lots of users from \nthe same set of ips but no likely spammers, so no alarm would trigger \nfor their network, or better the alarm would be less sensitive). AOL \ncould still give trouble though but even then, for one particular phone \nline/cable, the set of ip is probably quite small even less than a class \nC (using network subclassing). The spammers could still try to have \nseveral connections at different locations, but that increases their \ncost and so is not so much interesting.\n\n\tJehan\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board\nfor high-tech professionals.
