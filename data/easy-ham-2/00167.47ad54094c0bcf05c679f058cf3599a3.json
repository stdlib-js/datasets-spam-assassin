You'll end up with a boot loader\non the backup disk that contains the 'physical' location of\nthe /boot/map file on the main disk.  That won't necessarily\nbe the same as the backup disk.\n\nI can't think of a right way to do his with LILO.  I've got\na similar seup on my home machine (rsync to a backup disk\nevery night), but I'll be pulling out the RH install CDs to\nget LILO sorted if I have to do a disk swap.\n\nGRUB should be able to handle this no problem, since it\ndoesn't record sector numbers like LILO does.  Not much help\nfor you though...\n\nLater,\nKenn\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
