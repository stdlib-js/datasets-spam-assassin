I suppose that would count as across\ndifferent devices. \n\nIf you're wondering [probably not] why /mnt/public is there twice, its\nbecause I restored from tapebackup and I didn't know that it keeps the\ndirectory structure. I know now ;-)\n\nActually, how can I fix that quickly and easily? I thought about firstly\nmv'ing the structure to /tmp. Then copying it back again but I'm sure some\nwee genius knows a quickie solution. Mind you I never even bothered trying a\nits not a priority now that its all linked anyway. \n\nCW\n\n--------------------------------\n hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of\n redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or\n with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations\n are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a\n means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still\n considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways\n of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this\n hard link idea.\n\n but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling\n back of accidental overwrites.\n\n ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the \"snapshot\"\n  facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the\n  various \"versioning\" filesystems which appeared --- and\n  then vanished? --- over the years.... )\n\n one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any\n hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*\n files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets\n complain if there are hard links.\n\ncheers,\n\t-blf-\n--\n Innovative, very experienced, Unix and      | Brian Foster    Dublin,\nIreland\n Chorus (embedded RTOS) kernel internals     | e-mail: blf@utvinternet.ie\n expert looking for a new position ...       | mobile: (+353 or 0)86 854\n9268\n  For a r�sum�, contact me, or see my website  http://www.blf.utvinternet.ie\n\n    Stop E$$o (ExxonMobile):  �Whatever you do, don't buy Esso --- they\n     don't give a damn about global warming.�    http://www.stopesso.com\n     Supported by Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and numerous others...\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
