Some would say they were actually last to market.  The \nonly thing that was first about this is what they're calling \"nationwide \ncoverage\", and you could even (and perhaps should) argue with that.\n\n>   to me, there is nada more interesting and impactful going\n>down in the tech world than mobile visual communications.. and yet no one\n>seems to give much of a damn that right now that 2 persons can take photos\n>and share them instantly across space.  this is one of the biggest - and\n>last - fundamental changes in human communications.  will be as big as the\n>browser.\n\nCan you clarify why you think this is so?\n\nI'm in the midst of an ongoing argument with a guy who works for me about \nthis very subject.  He, like you, thinks that things like MMS are going to \nchange the world.  I am not convinced.\n\nWhat exactly about sending pictures to each other is going to have such a \nhuge impact?  I'm waiting to be convinced.  I just don't see how it changes \nhuman communication in any really amazing way - and no one who believes it \nhas yet done a good job explaining it to me.  I can understand SMS taking \noff, since communicating short text messages can be very useful in many \nsituations.  However, I just don't see what's the compelling reason for \nsending pictures around to each other on a regular basis.  Are there \ninstances when it makes sense?  Sure, I can think of plenty where it's a \nnice to have, but very few where it would be a \"man, I need this\" type of \nfeature.\n\nI mean, right now, at my desk, it's easy for me to text message with lots \nof people, and I do all the time.  If I wanted to, I could also very easily \nsnap a picture and send it to them, but I don't.  I did once, after I got a \nreally bad haircut, and a friend wanted to see how it looked - but that's a \nfairly limited use.  Obviously, that's just one case, and maybe I'm just \ntoo old (argh!) to really \"get\" this new photo taking and sharing stuff, \nbut I'm really trying to understand.\n\nSo, I'm not saying it won't be a \"fundamental change in human \ncommunications\", but I'd just like to know why you think it will be?\n\nMike\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
