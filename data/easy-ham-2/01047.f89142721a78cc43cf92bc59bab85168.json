I wouldn't necessary say hate lit.\n\nHate-lit rests on a premise that \"them\" are fundamentally different\ncritters from \"us\" and thus, by being \"them-like\" they, as a\nclassification, \"bring it on themselves\" for us to \"correct\" them by\nany means gruesome we might choose, after all, it's not /us/ pulling\nthe trigger, it's \"them\", right?  I've heard Bush say this (verbatim)\nmore than once, and with a straight face.\n\nCall it gay-bashing or whatever, it's convenient tunnel-vision and\nlies to justify violence against a creature genetically, morally and\nintellectually indistinguishable from your sister.  Go ahead, peel the\nskin off a random daughter of each of them and lay them side by side\non the pavement, and you tell me which one was racially guilty, which\none carried the \"infection\" the \"plague\" (note, not the \"antigen\" or\nthe \"hormone\", which have similar metaphoric effects to philosophy,\nbut they chose the fear-charged words)\n\n\"Make no mistake about it\" it oozes rhetorical vehicles to obfuscate\nit's lack of bits paragraph after paragraph in pushing an agenda to\n/excuse/ \"our\" violence and suspension of human rights to 'clense'\nourselves of \"them\", the 'non-human' (or lesser-human) objects of its\nhate.\n\nWhat else shall we call it?  Just anti-liberal?  \n\nBetter question: What if, as in physics, the laws of human behaviour\nare the same everywhere in the Universe?  What if Al Queda is in fact\nmore like our mafia or biker gangs or school board trustees? \n\nWhat if they operate by the same neural-annealing Maxima-Minima\ngratification mechanisms as you or I and every other creature on this\nplanet?  \n\nWhat if, instead of magically and uniquely alien, they are, just like\nour own captains and leaders, really only in it for the money, for\ntrade rights-of-way and for power over minions who will foolishly make\nit all happen, minions whom they can once again dup with /virtually/\n/identical/ rhetoric ... except we call theirs \"fundamentalist islam\",\nand they call ours \"imperialist satanism\"?\n\nWhen both sides can call the other \"evil\" to the cheers of their local\npublic and media, you can bet something's rotten in the state of Denmark.\n\nI guess that's why I live in the woods.  Bears and racoons I\nunderstand, but I really just don't 'get' people.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\n Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com\n\"Computers are useless.
