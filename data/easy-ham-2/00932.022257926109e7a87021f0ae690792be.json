I grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US ...\n\n... and there is a large excluded middle\nbetween those \"in poverty\" and those who\nare more affluent than \"working class\".\n\nI don't know what poverty officially is,\nbut from a CA perspective, $15k income is\nnot going to go far.  At current interest\nrates, one would probably want somewhere\naround $500k* wealth to throw that amount,\nwhich pretty much limits the non-working\nclass to a small, single-digit percentage\nof households.  (how much overlap do we\nhave with the retirement cohort here?)\n\nThe 2000 numbers pretty much confirm it:\n<http://ferret.bls.census.gov/macro/032001/hhinc/new06_000.htm>\nshows that the top 5% of incomes are mostly\ntwo+-earner households, and the zero-earner \nhouseholds are rare above median incomes.\nWe are the workers' paradise.\n\nThe census figured $18k as the cutoff for\nlowest 5th, so with that as a poverty line,\nthe percentages break down as follows:\n\nwork\\pov.  yes  no\nyes        9    72\nno        11     8\n\n-Dave\n\n:::::::::::\n\n* perhaps that's not even enough:\n\"[Irvine] \"Everyone has to take a job sometime\" / NH3\"\n<http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/july99/0711.html>\n\n(1998 wealth data was supposedly released\nin 2001, but I haven't seen it yet on the\ncensus site.
