(AOL, news, msgs) said in a regulatory\nfiling it is now focusing on messaging interoperability methods that are\nmore limited in scope than the kind envisioned by the Federal Communications\nCommission when it approved the AOL-Time Warner merger in January 2001.\n\nAmerica Online isn't required to make its messaging system interoperable\nwith others, but the FCC's merger approval included what it considered to be\nincentives for the company to do so. It also required AOL to file progress\nreports on its interoperability efforts every six months. The most recent\nreport, filed last week, disclosed the company's new direction.\n\nThe upshot of the strategy shift is that the instant-messaging market isn't\nmuch closer to broad-based interoperability than it was 18 months ago,\naccording to industry analysts. Unlike e-mail, users of most competing\ninstant-messaging services still can't directly trade messages. So an\nAmerica Online instant- messaging user can't communicate with a user of\nMicrosoft Corp.'s (MSFT, news, msgs) MSN Messenger, except by using\nthird-party software such as Trillian.\n\nAmerica Online, the biggest instant-messaging provider, has been criticized\nfor blocking users of rival services from gaining access to its users. The\ncompany also has been accused of dragging its feet amid industry attempts at\ninteroperability.\n\nFor its part, America Online has said it wants to protect the security of\nits users and the reliability of its system. And it points out that other\ncompanies have so far failed to agree on interoperability standards.\n\nWhen the FCC approved the AOL-Time Warner merger, it said that if America\nOnline wanted to offer video-conferencing and other advanced\ninstant-messaging features over Time Warner's cable lines, it first had to\nenable its instant- messaging users to communicate with users of rival\nservices. The intent of the condition was to prevent America Online from\nwidening its dominance of the instant-messaging market by exploiting its\naccess to Time Warner cable systems.\n\nAOL hasn't yet introduced video features, even though rivals Microsoft and\nYahoo Inc. (YHOO, news, msgs) did so last year.\n\nSpecifically, the FCC said America Online would have to implement a\ntechnology known as \"server-to-server interoperability\" before it could\noffer video. The technology would allow users of non-America Online services\nto detect when AOL users are online, and to trade messages. It would do so\nvia communications between the computer servers operated by each messaging\nprovider, using a common language.\n\nBut in the progress report filed with the FCC last week, America Online said\nit will \"focus its efforts\" on alternatives to server-to-server\ninteroperability. They are more limited in scope than server-to-sever.\n\nAs an example of an alternative, America Online cited a recent agreement to\nmake its instant-messaging service compatible with a new messaging service\nfrom Apple Computer Corp. (AAPL, news, msgs). The Apple service, IChat, will\nbe included in Mac OS X 10.2, the new Apple operating system set for release\nin August.\n\nIChat users will be able to talk to America Online users, but it won't\ninvolve server-to-server interoperability. Instead, the actual exchange of\nmessages will occur only on America Online's servers, even as IChat\ncustomers use Apple software.\n\n\"We believe this kind of hosted IM solution provides, at least in the short\nterm, a secure, reliable and cost-effective means to provide\ninteroperability between AOL, IM and unaffiliated IM communities,\" Steven\nTeplitz, AOL's associate general counsel, wrote in the progress report to\nthe FCC.\n\nAs to the apparent change in strategy, company spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan\nsaid Tuesday: \"It's a recognition that server-to-server has proven a hard\nnut to crack for the entire industry.\" Indeed, users of America Online's\nrival services can't directly communicate with each other, either.\n\nThe alternative solution \"was something that we could implement now to\nprovide for IM communities to communicate,\" said Ms. McKiernan, adding\nAmerica Online would explore partnerships with other messaging providers,\nsimilar to the Apple deal. None has been announced so far.\n\nFCC officials couldn't be reached Tuesday.\n\nAmerica Online hasn't ruled out the possibility that it would someday\nimplement server-to-server interoperability. The company has explored the\ntechnology in the past, including a server-to-server last year with Lotus\nDevelopment, a unit of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM, news,\nmsgs).\n\nBut America Online's interoperability test with Lotus was \"limited in scope\nand functionality.\" True server-to-server technology \"would require further\nsignificant expenditures of time and resources to develop,\" wrote Mr.\nTeplitz.\n\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force, a group devoted to developing Internet\nstandards, has been working on a server-to-server messaging technology but\nhasn't yet developed a final version, according to America Online. Task\nforce representatives couldn't be reached.\n\nThe company's strategy shift means that true interoperability in instant\nmessaging is still a couple of years away, according to Michael Gartenberg,\nanalyst with Jupiter Research.\n\n\"It's still something the market wants,\" he said. \"At some point, it'll\nhappen, but maybe a couple of years down the road.\"\n\nMr. Gartenberg and other analysts believe America Online hasn't actively\npursued true interoperability because it wants to protect its large user\nbase. If messaging systems were compatible, the company could lose ground\nbecause prospective customers might see no difference in choosing another\nprovider, as long as they can reach America Online users.\n\nBut partly because of its lack of compatibility and the FCC conditions,\nAmerica Online hasn't kept up with rivals in offering new services. MSN and\nYahoo have had video-conferencing via instant-messaging since last year. AOL\nhas denied that it has held back on video messaging to avoid making its\nsystem interoperable, arguing there is little consumer demand for it.\n\nBut the new features have paid off for the company's rivals, and they are\ncatching up. Between last October and April, Microsoft's Messenger user base\nrose 32% to 29.1 million, according to ComScore Media Metrix, while Yahoo's\nbase jumped 19% to 19.2 million users. In the same period, the number of\nusers of AOL-branded messaging services increased 7% to 54.9 million.\n\n\n-Peter Loftus; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5267; peter.loftus@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
