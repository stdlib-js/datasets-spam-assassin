Also, apt 0.5 is being actively\ndeveloped and already contains enough fixes to be compiled on Limbo with\ngcc 3.2.\n\n> In addition, the rpmlib stuff has changed slightly - I've not really\n> started on this, but it's mainly just arguments added.

That's what I'm doing\ncurrently on my home Rawhide system.\n\nMatthias\n\n-- \nMatthias Saou                                World Trade Center\n-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta\nSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain\nElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
