It's a GUI front-end to gconf\nsettings (and metacity has it's settings handled by gconf, like\nall good gnome2 apps). It's true there's no designated metacity\nconfigurator - but the whole point of metacity is to have\nreasonable defaults, and thus get away from the need for settings\naltogether, and have the window manager be not in the way (as so\nmany are).\n\nAs to the sawfish issue, no idea, sorry - are you sure that\ngnome2's panel handles 1.4 applets at all?\n\nCheers,\nDave.\n\n-- \n       David Neary,\n    Marseille, France\n  E-Mail: bolsh@gimp.org\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
