I've two machines,\npretty much the same hardware. \nathlon 1700XP's, both have NVidia cards, one Gforce3 Ti and a Gforce2MX,\nboth use the same driver module. \n\nBoth have same kernel version albeit it compiled for their particular\nhardware.\n\nOne works perfectly, the other fails to load. When I check with lsmod, I can\nsee the NVdriver is loaded, but not used ;--(\nThus when I startx, it bombs out. \n\nIU still have X with the default nv driver and crappy accelleration -->\n650fps with glxgears [should be over 2000fps]\nIts not a hardware issue with the cards as I swapped them over and get the\nsame symptoms. \n\nI reckon my mobo is cack, I've tried swapping slots around, reserving\nresources etc all to no avail. \nShould there be an interrupt for the nv card? I haven't checked the other\nbox yet.\n\nRegards,\nCW\n\n-------------------\nOn Tue, 03 Dec 2002, Mark Page wrote:\n\n> Was running Debian Woody perfectly well until I installed the NVIDIA 3D \n> tar packages.\n\nYou probably stil are ;)\n\n> Both the kernel and GLX packages installed with no problem and I then \n> amended the XFree config file appropriately (according to all \n> instructions).

You should be able to use kdm\nor gdm with the nvidia Xserver.  What exactly did you change in your\nXF86Config?

Then put this on\na new line in \n\n/etc/modules\n\nin order that linux will load it on boot.  You can just do\n\nmodprobe nvdriver\n\nto load it by hand.  Your make install did this as well as reinstalling the\ndriver in /lib etc.  You should also get a message saying loading the\nnvidia driver taints your kernel (which it does, in the sense that it's not\nopen source).\n\n> Is this a problem anyone else has encountered and what is the best \n> solution?

As\ndebian has lots of potential kernels they can't have one nvdriver package\nand have chosen instead to provide the source.  Actually I don't know if\nthey're permitted to distribute binaries by nvidia's license anyway.\n\nGavin\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
