So it could be thousands of \nactual real, different, emails per day.  The \"very high rate \ntriggers alarms\" thing is certainly something which would be \npossible to check for, but there may be legitimate ways to \nexhibit this behavior -- can't think of one right now but \"AOL \nproxy server\" springs to mind as an example from another domain.\n\nC\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board\nfor high-tech professionals.
