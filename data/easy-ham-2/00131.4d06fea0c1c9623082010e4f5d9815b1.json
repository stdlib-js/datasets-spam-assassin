On Intel \nplatforms software is compiled for i386 processors by default. If you don't\nwish to run software on other machines other than your own, you might want to\nchange the default compiler options so that they will be compiled with a \nhigher optimization level, and generate code for your specific architecture.\n\nTherefore:\n\n    export CFLAGS=\"-O3 -march=<architecture>\" &&\n    CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS\n\nThis is a minimal set of optimizations that ensures it works on almost all\nplatforms. The option march will compile the binaries with specific\ninstructions for that CPU you have specified. This means you can't copy this\nbinary to a lower class CPU and execute it.\n\nSo these are the optimizations I need to worry about, and the optimizations \nthat lfs says to disable before compiling GCC or GlibC. However, GlibC seems \nthe most likely candidate for optimization since it provides the libs used by \neven the most simple programs to access system calls in the kernel.\n\nI'm still waiting for info from the GCC mailing list RE: optimising/patching \nGCC for performance improvement. So far the only suggestion has been to try \nusing icc, Intels C compiler. It's known to work with the kernel, but user \napps, and I guess libs and such might need rewriting to compile, and I'm not \nprepared to go to this length.\n\nFor QT and KDE it seems there are also gains to be made with object \npre-linking, but there are also risks with this so I'll just have to suck it \nand see. Either way, I'm going to get started building the base today. I'm \nstill waiting for some DRI patches for my GVX1 card but it'll probably been \nseveral days before I'm ready to build X anyway.\n\nCheers,\n\n\tJohn Gay\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
