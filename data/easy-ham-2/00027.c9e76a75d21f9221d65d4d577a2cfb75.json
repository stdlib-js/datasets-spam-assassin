It does look like a Siamese or (more likely)\nAbyssinian.  If you want one of these breeds, I hope you're prepared\nto part with �BIGNUM; they're not cheap.\n\nThere aren't a lot of \"quality\" cat breeders in Ireland, and they tend\nnot to have many kittens for sale, so I don't know how feasible it is\nto get a Siamese or Abyssinian in a hurry.  \"Not very\", is my best\nguess.\n\n> I see the Burmese are nice but I like the pointy ears of the\n> Siamese.\n\nSiamese *in general* aren't the friendliest of cats; they tend to be\nslightly overbred and you end up with hissing maniacs as a result.\nAbys tend to be nicer, and Burmese nicer still.  You can be lucky with\nindividual cats, though.\n\n         Colm\n\n-- \nColm Buckley | colm@tuatha.org | +353 87 2469146 | www.colm.buckley.name\nSantaclaustrophobia: Fear of crowded holiday shopping.\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group Social Events: social@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/social for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
