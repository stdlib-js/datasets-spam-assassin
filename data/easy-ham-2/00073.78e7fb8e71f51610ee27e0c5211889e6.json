To be honest, I'm trying to\n  | think of a useful use of hard links right now, and I'm a little\n  | stumped. There's gotta be some benefit that I'm missing that's\n  | immediately obvious to everyone.\n\n maybe, maybe not.   yonks ago, I seem to recall dmr saying,\n or at least alleged to have said, something along the lines\n that soft and hard links both make sense in isolation, but\n having both does not.  if this is even close to correct,\n yer in quite good company!\n\n there is at least one notable difference, and a host of minor\n ones.  the notable difference is the data always exists (and\n is apriori accessible) for hard links --- there is no such\n thing as a broken link.\n\n I use this fact on occasion to \"save\" data, via the well-\n known attack of hard-linking to a supposedly-temporary file\n I want to preserve.  the subsequent unlink(2)ing of the\n \"temporary\" file does not destroy the data.\n \ncheers!\n\t-blf-\n--\n Innovative, very experienced, Unix and      | Brian Foster    Dublin, Ireland\n Chorus (embedded RTOS) kernel internals     | e-mail: blf@utvinternet.ie\n expert looking for a new position ...       | mobile: (+353 or 0)86 854 9268\n  For a résumé, contact me, or see my website  http://www.blf.utvinternet.ie\n\n    Stop E$$o (ExxonMobile):  «Whatever you do, don't buy Esso --- they\n     don't give a damn about global warming.»    http://www.stopesso.com\n     Supported by Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and numerous others...\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
