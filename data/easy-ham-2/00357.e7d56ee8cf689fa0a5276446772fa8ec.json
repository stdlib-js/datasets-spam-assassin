A licence\nattaches to a _copy_ of a creative work.  So, if there was a\nproprietary, non-redistributable copy in SuSE boxed sets, it's still\nproprietary and non-redistributable -- unless SAP AG decided to mail out\na separate permission grant for it.\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
