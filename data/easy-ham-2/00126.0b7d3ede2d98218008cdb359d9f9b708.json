In this case, I had two issues.  1. I mirrored the disk to give to\nsomeone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2\nprocessor.  2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I\nwanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware\nrelated.  Again, it's also an interesting exercise...\n \n> Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious\n> hassle down the line. \n\nOh, I'm doing that too.  This is going to Africa so I'm aiming for as\nrobust as possible with belt, braces and probably an all-in-one jumpsuit!\nI'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning\nstrike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise)  I'm also going for a\nbackup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org .  The\nadmin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got\nfried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible\ninstall will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...\n\nConor\n-- \nConor Daly <conor.daly@oceanfree.net>\n\nDomestic Sysadmin :-)\n---------------------\nFaenor.cod.ie\n  2:32pm  up 64 days, 23:49,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00\nHobbiton.cod.ie\n  2:19pm  up 7 days, 20:56,  1 user,  load average: 0.05, 0.02, 0.00\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
