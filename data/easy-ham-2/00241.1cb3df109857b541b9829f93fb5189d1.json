And that is the risk you\n_always_ take when you blindly buy hardware systems for Linux without\nverifying chipset support, first.  If anything, Dell have over the years\noccasioned less such trouble than have many competitors, in this area.\n\n-- \nCheers,   If C gives you enough rope to hang yourself, then C++ give you enough\nRick Moen    to bind and gag your neighbourhood, rig the sails on a small ship,\nrick@linuxmafia.com    and still have enough to hang yourself from the yardarm.\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
