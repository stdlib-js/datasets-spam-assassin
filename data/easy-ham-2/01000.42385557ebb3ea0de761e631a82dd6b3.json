Moreover, worms which use email as\nvector exist *only* because a single vendor ships mailers with broken\ndefault settings, and insists to make documents executables. This makes\nfor very bad press, and eventually that vendor is going to wise up, and \nstop shipping as many broken wares (or people will switch to more secure \nalternatives, whatever comes first).\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
