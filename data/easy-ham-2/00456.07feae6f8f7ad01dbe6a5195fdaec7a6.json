However, I didn't realise that Windows altered the hw clock\nas there was no mention of it in any of the docs I read. \nI still dual-boot on a regular basis and if Windows is sneakily messing\nwith the clock, I'd be interested to know in what way it is and how it\ncouild be stopped from doing so. Everything seems to work fine since I\nset the system up but I still don't like to have these gaps in my\nknowledge.\n\nRegards,\nAnthony Geoghegan\n-- \nThe worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them,\nbut to be indifferent to them.
