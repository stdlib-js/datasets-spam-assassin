Nonetheless, Microsoft has tried\nto spread FUD about the viral nature of the GPL to make CEO/CIO level people\n(often not the most technically clueful, even the CIOs) fear that if they so\nmuch as use a Linux box, as, say, a print server, they'll have to make their\ncompany's entire IP public. (I don't think Microsoft said precisely what I\njsut said, but that was the tenor of the remarks). And their marketing\nbudget is a tad bigger than yours or mine.\n\n\n\nNiall\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
