I still disagree with the \nreasoning, but it seems this is one of those philosophical questions \nthat I'm on the losing end of :)\n\nThe checkinstall utility that someone mentioned seems useful, but I \ndon't really have the time to figure it out right now. After searching \nthe web some more, I found out that Mandrake's version of rpm is \npatched to support what I wanted. So I guess I'll look into that when \nI get a chance.\n\nOn Thu, Aug 15, 2002 at 05:14:47PM +0200, Ralf Ertzinger wrote:\n> Do nothing in the %build section, and copy the existing binaries\n> in %install.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this could be useful for my situation too. It's \nnot a complete solution since I can't really distribute the SRPMS with \nfull certainty that they work, but at least I can make RPMS for local \nuse by tarring up the buildroot directory and then using the above \ntechnique. All I really want is to get dependency tracking for \neverything installed on my system (including software from cvs). This \njust makes it a little bit faster.\n\ngary\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n"}
