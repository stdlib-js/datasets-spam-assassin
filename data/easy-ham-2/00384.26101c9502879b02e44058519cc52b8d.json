To make money they need to sell products. To ensure they sell\ntheir product, they must provide something that other vendors do not.\n\nThe down side is that this produces many variations of the same product. The\nbenefit of open source is that there is a common standard which everyone can\nshare. (The up side is that the competition drives the different\norganisations to constantly improve their product offering[2].)\n\nSo unlike SunOS vs AIX vs HPUX vs Tru64, where the API's and available\nfunctionality were often starkly different, Linux distributions are mostly\nthe same.\n\nWhile I may have to look in /var/named on Red Hat, and /etc/bind on Debian,\nthe binaries are basically the same, as are the man pages. In most cases,\ndoing a \"man named\" will reveal the compiled location of the config files.\nSo long as this is understood, it is easy enough to administer most Linux\ndistributions.\n\nI expect that as companies and public sector organisations begin to\nunderstand the open source paradigm, you will find even more distributions\nappearing. The reason I believe this is that deriving a new distribution\nfrom, say, Debian requires comparatively little effort. I would see this\nrequiring slightly more effort than the amount of time many enterprise\nadmins spend trying to customise the desktops, screen savers and software\ndistribution mechanisms of their own organisations.\n\nIMHO, as always...\n\n\n- Matthew\n\n[1] Depending on your world view, this may be rephrased as \"they need to\nmake oodles of profits and screw the little man to survive.\" This discussion\nis beyond the scope of this list. :)\n\n[2] The often overlooked problem with competition is that it weakens the\n\"combatants\", leaving the field open for a less powerful force to take over\nand entrench its position (in this case I would be referring to Microsoft).\nHowever, I do not believe this will effect the Linux movement as all the\nvendors are obliged to work together to a great degree, thanks to the GPL.\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\nhttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
