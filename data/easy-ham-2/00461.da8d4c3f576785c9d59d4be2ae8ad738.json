I am completely new\nto Linux and therefore have run into a few problems.\n\nThe graphic display on my PC doesnt seem to work. My monitor is slightly\nmiss-aligned and I cannot run any high resolution games ( everything freezes\n). In the hardware browser in Gnome it lists my Graphics Card (Riva TNT2),\nand shows installed drivers...... maybe the problem lies elswhere.\n\nAnother problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT\nSpeed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again\nit is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.\n\nIf anybody has any ideas, please let me know cos id like to use Linux more.\nPlease keep in mind I am new to it though.\n\nThanks\n\nMark\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
