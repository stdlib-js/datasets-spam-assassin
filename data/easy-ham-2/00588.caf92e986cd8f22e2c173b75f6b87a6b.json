There's still so little info on TES and those of us\nhere since RazorV1 know how it works.  I did set my min_cf to \"ac-100\"\nwhich I thought would be zero.  \n\nSo the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a\ntrust level of 1 and have to work their way up.  Your trust level\nincreases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must\nhave been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the\nchanges dumped everyone's trust level.  Now here come the questions...\n\nWhat engine signature does TES look at?  Does it have to be the same e1\nsignature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures.  How many people have\nto nominate the message before everyones rating increases?  How many\nrevokes decreases someones rating?  Does a single revoke decrease the\nrating of everyone that nominated the message?  If a newby reports a\nmessage that has already been reported does their trust level\nimmediately go up?  In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust\nlevel of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple\npeople with higher trust levels?\n\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Vipul Ved Prakash [mailto:mail@vipul.net] \nSent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 4:22 AM\nTo: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net\nSubject: Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now?\n\n\nBobby, \n\nCouple of things: \n\nIf you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an\nimmediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the\nconfidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam.\nThis might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users\ngrows the time delay between nominations and determination will become\nshorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their\nlegit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting.\n\nAlso, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in\nrazor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended\naverage confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should\nreturn true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a\ntrusted user).\n\napt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a\n_maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate.\n\ncheers,\nvipul.\n\n\nOn Wed, Aug 07, 2002 at 11:51:21PM -0400, Rose, Bobby wrote:\n> This is still happening.
