From these if there aren't any linux drivers you can\nusually find out the chipset of each device. Plug them into google with\n\"linux\" and see what people have to say about them. Generally speaking when\nyou buy the system you'll be told the make/model of each device rather than\nthe chipset, so further investigation is necessary.\n\n\tThe cavaet, of course, is always to know exactly what you're buying.\nIn most people's cases unfortunately it's not the person who bought the\nsystems that will be configuring them.\n\nsteve\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
