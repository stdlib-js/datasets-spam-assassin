Not sure it's worthwhile to pay for that when I'm already\npaying for cable modem at home, but... still nice to know I have the\noption.\n\nFWIW, slummerville actually has the internet- not just broadband, but\nactual broadband competition, which I gather is rare. I had ADSL and two\ncable options when I moved in.\n\nLuis\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
