I have a server with SME5.5 installed\n- used to be e-smith. It's based on RH7.1, has a 3c507 NIC, and is\nconnected to a hub. Also connected to the hub are a laptop and\nworkstation, both with RH7.3 . The server supplies DHCP amongst other\nthings.\n\tThe problem is interruptions in the network. If I ping the laptop from\nthe workstation, or the other way around, there are no problems, i.e.\nshows up as 0% loss. If however I ping the server from the laptop or\nworkstation, it will do a few packets, anywhere from 3 to 20, and then\nstop responding, it will start again after a little while.\n\tThe server is definitely not overloaded, 128Mb, and seems to be\nconfigured correctly. In /etc/modules.conf,;\n\noptions 3c507 irq=0x5 io=0x300\nalias eth0 3c507\n\nthere is an option in there for something called hisax, but whatever\nthat is, the machine doesn't have one.\n\tdoing route shows 192.168.0.0 as going through eth0 which is correct.\n\n\tAny help on this appreciated.\n\n\tEamonn\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
