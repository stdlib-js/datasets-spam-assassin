Look as if OnStream (spun\noff from Philips Electronics in 1998) invented and rather tightly\ncontrol the format, though other companies such as Verbatim do make\ncompatible media under licence.\n\nIf you're reasonably serious about backup, you need to plan for a\nrotational backup scheme and retirement of tapes as they become worn\n(and well before they start failing).  That requires at least a couple\nof dozen tapes for the first couple of years.  Therefore, cost and\navailability of media are (or should be) a major factor.  Also, tape\nheads wear out and need to be replaced (more rapidly for helical-scan\nsystems -- which ADR turns out _not_ to be), and somehow that always\nends up being cheaper for tape technologies in which there is heavy\ncompetition.\n\nThe less-tangible consideration that comes most immediately to mind is\nthat, if one's OnStream ADR drive fails, the only possible replacement\nthat would suffice to restore your accumulated backup sets is another \nOnStream ADR drive.  In that sense, you're somewhat locked in:  I'm \nnot seeing ADR drives from anyone else (though I might have missed\nthem).  \n\nIf OnStream are smart, they've priced the drives to attract people into\nthe system, and are making up the shortfall on media cost after they \nget people to buy in.   I see the following prices for mail order \n(http://www.finnsoft.com/priclist/verbat.htm) of Verbatim-brand tapes:\n\n42 euros for 30 GB ADR tape\n33 euros for 30 GB ADR tape, four-pack.\n66 euros for 50 GB ADR tape.\n44 euros for 50 GB ADR tape, four-pack.\n47 euros for ADR cleaning tape.\n\n(You don't get much lower pricing than Verbatim, without going no-name.)\n\nCapacities are usually quoted on the basis of a nominal 2:1 compression\nratio.  The PDF datasheet for Onstream's \"ADR2\" series says this is a\nlinear-serpentine recording technology (a good thing) like DLT, SDLT,\nand LTO, rather than a helical-scan method typified by DDS/DAT, AIT, and\n8mm (which puts heavy wear on tapes on heads).\n\nI'm not sure what software other than NovaStor's TapeCopy and Yosemite\nTechnology's Tapeware will support OnStream's drives.  My recollection\nis that BRU will do it.\n\nOn balance, I'd personally _still_ go with a DDS4 drive using either DDS3\nor DDS4 media, mostly because once you've survived life with one\noddball, less-standard tape format, you're not in a hurry to repeat the\nexperience.  But ADR does seem at a quick glance to be well designed,\nand might be a good bet after all.
