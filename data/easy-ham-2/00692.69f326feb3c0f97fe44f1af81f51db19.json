Unless you're going \nto run out and build a platform that executes Voice XML code and \ncan support IMAP etc. then the easiest way to do this is to \nleverage VOXEO's service.  You can start building on it for free \nand you will pay > $0.10 per minute for the pleasure of \nusing/testing the service.\n\nhttp://www.voxeo.com\n\nIf you have about $50K to throw at the project then you can look at \nNUANCE, which has a platform that combines VoiceXML/VXML, Speech \nReco, and the L&H speech synthesize, which will allow you to have \nyour email read to you by Stephen Hawking.\n\nTellMe & BeVocal have off-the-shelf services that do this, though, \nbut from my testing, they suck.\n\nIf I were to build this I'd spec a lightweight IMAP client and \nVoiceXML browser and dump them on VOXEO.\n\nHowever, you'll find this to be extremely slow and frustrating.  \nBetter to us a screen phone with a WAP client.\n\n-Ian.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 17, 2002, at 09:53 PM, Mr. FoRK wrote:\n\n\n> I was talking to a friend today about voice applications - using a \n> phone to\n> get mail or info (other things are possible, but that's what we talked\n> about).\n> He's running a mail server called X-Mail (or something) and it has \n> a Web UI\n> written with some PHP pages.
