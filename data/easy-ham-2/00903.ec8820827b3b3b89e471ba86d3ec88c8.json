After we've actually started looking \nfor deep infrasound (pressure waves) with a network of stations designed \nto enforced the nuke test ban treaty we've discovered that pretty big \nimpacts are the norm. Current infrasound stations can detect \nbolides/meteoroids in ~10 T TNT scale, but some 10 kT events are \nrelatively frequent. A number of people died in the Tunguska event (1908, \n10-15 MT), despite it hitting in the middle of nowhere.\n\nhttp://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:637JrhGDB5gC:www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/5thMars99/pdf/6081.pdf+bolide+impact+kT+wave&hl=en&ie=UTF-8\n\nIn the Earth atmosphere a large number of bright light flashes of energies\nin light impulse of about 0.1- 1 kt TNT and higher have been registered by\nUSA DoD satellites equipped with photoelectric detectors [9-11]. Intense\nlight impulses are created by impacts of meteoroids disrupted in the\natmosphere (mainly at altitudes of about 30-45 km). Several techniques for\nthe assessment of meteor- oid's characteristics from the light curves and\nheights of peak intensities have been developed [3,12]. Using these\ntechniques the preatmospheric kinetic energy for Fifth International\nConference on Mars INITIATION OF SANDSTORMS: I.V.Nemtchinov, O.P.Popova,\nV.A.Rybakov, V.V.Shuvalov a number of events was determined. The biggest\nevent is the 1 February 1994 with ini- tial energy as high as 30-40 kt TNT\n(or initial mass of about 400 t). The bright flash with light energy of\nabout 4.5 kt TNT was caused by this meteoroid which deeply penetrated into\nthe atmosphere (at an angle of 45 degrees and velocity of 24 km/s) and\ndisintegrated above at altitudes of about 34 km and 21 km [9,12]. Another\nfamous impact event, the Sikhote-Alin meteor shower (12 February 1947\nevent), may be compared with the 1 February 1994 event. Initial masses of\nthese meteoroids are probably the same, as well as the angle of trajectory\ninclination, but the initial velocity of the Sikhote-Alin is almost twice\nsmaller. That caused fragmentation of 1 February 1994 meteoroid at higher\naltitudes and probably large fragments constitute a smaller part of the\npre- breakdown mass in contrast to the Sikhote-Alin event. In a rarefied\natmosphere of Mars analogous im- pactors will penetrate into deeper layers\nof the atmos- phere.They will disintegrate lower 15 km or even reach the\nplanet surface, partially in disrupted form. Only the first disruption\nwould occur if a meteoroid similar to that caused the 1 February 1994 will\nenter into the Martian atmosphere. And this body would reach the Mars\nsurface as a tense swarm of fragments. The meteoroid similar to that\ncaused the Sikhote-Alin event would hit the surface in a form of large\nfrag- ments due to its low velocity. They will create crater with the size\nsimilar to that of the undisrupted meteoroid.\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
