We argued that it was as good a\nscheme for misery as any, since its success in keeping the common people\nreasonably happy and proud depended on the strength of the people\nthemselves - and yet it described no practical machinery which would tend\nto make the people, as opposed to their elected representatives, strong.\n    We said it was possible that the framers of the Constitution were\nblind to the beauty of persons who were without great wealth or powerful\nfriends or public office, but who were nonetheless genuinely strong.\n    We thought it was more likely, though, that the framers had not\nnoticed that it was natural, and therefore almost inevitable, that human\nbeings in extraordinary and enduring situations should think of themselves\nas composing new families. Eliza and I pointed out that this happened no\nless in democracies than in tyrannies, since human beings were the same\nthe wide world over, and civilized only yesterday.\n    Elected representatives, hence, could be expected to become members of\nthe famous and powerful family of elected representatives - which would,\nperfectly naturally, make them wary and squeamish and stingy with respect\nto all the other sorts of families which, again, perfectly naturally,\nsubdivided mankind.\n    Eliza and I, thinking as halves of a single genius, proposed that the\nConstitution be amended so as to guarantee that every citizen, no matter\nhow humble or crazy or incompetent or deformed, somehow be given\nmembership in some family as covertly xenophobic and crafty as the one\ntheir public servants formed.\n    Good for Eliza and me!\n    Hi ho.\"\n\nKurt V\nSlapstick\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
