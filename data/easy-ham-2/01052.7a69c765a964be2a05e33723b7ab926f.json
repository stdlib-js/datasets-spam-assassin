It's supposed to\nanalyse brain and heart activity. While you can pick up heartbeat by\nDoppler radar, later tells it's realtime DSP on an array of SQIDs. Later\nthey mention they use passive IR imaging and eye saccade evaluation. Maybe\nthey're also doing a Kirlian reading, and recording your mana flux, too.\n(Conclusive evaluation by entrail reading is nonoptional only for\nconfirmed terrorists).\n\nSo they claim terrorist intent translates in biosignatures they can pick\nup by close-distance passive telemetry, in realtime, with a very low\nnumber of false positives, while having no chance to calibrate, in the\nfield.\n\nRight.\n\nSeems somebody is so awfully eager to pick up a slice of research grant\npie from the heimatland securitate money they haven't even bothered to \ninvent a plausible lie.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
