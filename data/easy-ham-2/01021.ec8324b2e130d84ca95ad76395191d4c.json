And the non-pecuiary since of violation,\nloss, and trouble has to get in there somewhere if we are really picky.\n\nI don't think considering marginal utility of dollars has value in this\nsituation.  We aren't debating whether the thief is better off -- he is.\n\nI'm not a lawyer either.  I played one on TV once but I didn't play a\nvery good one and they canceled it after the first episode ...\n\nThe situtation I described came from my recollection of Epstein's\n'Takings'.  He was specifically rejecting the idea of absolute property\nright found in Liberation theology and was using the idea -- that in an\nemergency where my life depends upon it I'm entitled to violate your\nproperty rights and (more) you are forbidden from using unreasonable\nforce to defend them (particularly if you aren't around).\n\nMaybe I did get it all wrong, but that particular recollection is\nrelatively strong precisely because it gave a good reason why my\nlibertarian theology needed to be modified.\n\nHe was also analyzing what the common law had come up with, which might\nnot be the statuatory law in a particular jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\n> Russell Turpin\n> Sent: Monday, August 12, 2002 2:15 PM\n> To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org\n> Subject: RE: David Friedman: Mail Me the Money!\n> \n> John Hall:\n> >The case against theft also acknowledges that the value to the thief\nis\n> >often far less than the value to the victim.
