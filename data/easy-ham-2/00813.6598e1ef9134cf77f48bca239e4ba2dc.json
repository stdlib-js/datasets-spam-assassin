It purports to trace, at least in\nbroad strokes, cosmic history from the millisecond after\ntime began, when the universe was a boiling stew of energy\nand subatomic particles, through the formation of atoms,\nstars, galaxies and planets to the vast, dilute, dark\nfuture in which all of these will have died. \n\nThe universe, the cosmologists say, was born 14 billion\nyears ago in the Big Bang. Most of its material remains\nresides in huge clouds of invisible so-called dark matter,\nperhaps elementary particles left over from the primordial\nexplosion and not yet identified. \n\nWithin these invisible clouds, the glittery lights in the\nsky that have defined creation for generations of humans\nare swamped, like flecks of foam on a rolling sea. A good\ncase can be made, scientists now agree, that the universe\nwill go on expanding forever. \n\nIn fact, recent observations have suggested that the\nexpansion of the universe is speeding up over cosmic time,\nunder the influence of a \"dark energy\" even more mysterious\nthan dark matter. \n\nRecently, a group of astronomers led by Dr. William\nPercival at the University of Edinburgh combined data from\na variety of observations to compile, based on the simplest\ntheoretical model, what they say is the most precise\nenumeration yet of the parameters that cosmologists have\nbeen fighting about for all these decades. \n\nThe universe, they calculated, is 13.89 billion years old,\nplus or minus half a billion years. Only 4.8 percent of it\nis made of ordinary matter. Matter of all types, known and\nunknown, luminous and dark, accounts for just 27.5 percent.\nThe rest of creation, 72.5 percent, is the mysterious dark\nenergy, they reported in a paper submitted last month to\nThe Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. \n\nIt is a picture that in some ways is surprisingly simple,\nsatisfying long-held theoretical prejudices about how the\nuniverse should be designed. Continued agreement with\ncoming experiments may mean that science is approaching the\nend of a \"great program\" of cosmological tests that began\nin the 1930's, Dr. P. J. E. Peebles of Princeton and Dr.\nBharat Ratra of Kansas State University said in the draft\nof a coming article for The Reviews of Modern Physics. \n\nIn other ways this new dark universe is utterly baffling, a\nroad map to new mysteries. Dr. Marc Davis, a cosmologist at\nthe University of California at Berkeley, called it \"a\nuniverse chock full of exotics that don't make sense to\nanybody.\" \n\nMoreover there are some questions that scientists still do\nnot know how to ask, let alone answer, scientifically. Was\nthere anything before the Big Bang? Is there a role for\nlife in the cosmos? Why is there something rather than\nnothing at all? Will we ever know? \n\n\"We know much, but we still understand very little,\" said\nDr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of\nChicago. \n\nThe Big Question \n\nExpanding Forever, \nOr Big Crunch? \n\nThe dim caves of Lascaux, the plains of\nStonehenge and the dreamtime tales of Australian aborigines\nall testify to the need to explain the world and existence.\nThis quest took its present form in 1917. That was when\nAlbert Einstein took his new general theory of relativity,\nwhich explained how matter and energy warp space-time to\nproduce gravity, and applied it to the universe. \n\nEinstein discovered that the cosmos as his theory described\nit would be unstable, prone to collapse under its own\ngravity. Astronomers, however, were sure that the universe\nwas stable. So Einstein added a fudge factor that he called\nthe cosmological constant to his equations. It acted as a\nlong-range repulsive force to counterbalance gravity. \n\nIn 1929, the astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the\nuniverse was expanding. The sky was full of distant\ngalaxies all rushing away from us and one another, as if\npropelled by what the British astronomer Dr. Fred Hoyle\nlater called derisively a \"big bang.\" The universe was not\nstable and, thus, did not require counterbalancing.\nEinstein abandoned his constant, referring to it as his\nbiggest blunder. But it would return to haunt cosmologists,\nand the universe. \n\nHoyle's term stuck, and the notion of an explosive genesis\nbecame orthodoxy in 1965, when Dr. Arno Penzias and Dr.\nRobert Wilson, radio astronomers at Bell Laboratories,\ndiscovered a faint uniform radio glow that pervaded the\nsky. It was, cosmologists concluded, the fading remnant of\nthe primordial fireball itself. \n\nRelieved of their fudge factor, the equations describing\nEinstein's universe were simple. Dr. Allan Sandage, the\nCarnegie Observatories astronomer, once called cosmology\n\"the search for two numbers\" - one, the Hubble constant,\ntelling how fast the universe is expanding, and the other\ntelling how fast the expansion is slowing, and thus whether\nthe universe will expand forever or not. \n\nThe second number, known as the deceleration parameter,\nindicated how much the cosmos had been warped by the\ndensity of its contents. In a high-density universe, space\nwould be curved around on itself like a ball. Such a\nuniverse would eventually stop expanding and fall back\ntogether in a big crunch that would extinguish space and\ntime, as well as the galaxies and stars that inhabit them.\nA low-density universe, on the other hand, would have an\nopposite or \"open\" curvature like a saddle, harder to\nenvision, and would expand forever. \n\nIn between with no overall warpage at all was a\n\"Goldilocks\" universe with just the right density to expand\nforever but more and more slowly, so that after an infinite\ntime it would coast to a stop. This was a \"flat\" universe\nin the cosmological parlance, and to many theorists the\nsimplest and most mathematically beautiful solution of all.\n\n\nBut the sky did not yield those cosmic numbers easily, even\nwith the help of the 200-inch Hale telescope on Palomar\nMountain in Southern California, dedicated in 1948, which\nhad been built largely for that task. Dr. Hubble wrote of\nmeasuring shadows and searching \"among ghostly errors of\nmeasurement for landmarks that are scarcely more\nsubstantial.\" \n\nThe Dark Side \n\nInvisible Matter \nMolds Galaxies \n\n\nIt was not till the mid-70's, a\nquarter-century after the Palomar giant began operating,\nthat groups of astronomers reached the tentative conclusion\nthat the universe they could see - stars, gas, planets and\ngalaxies - did not have nearly enough gravitational oomph\nto stop the cosmic expansion. \n\n\"So the universe will continue to expand forever and\ngalaxies will get farther and farther apart, and things\nwill just die,\" Dr. Sandage said at the time. \n\nBut the Great Argument was just beginning. Apparently there\nwas a lot of the universe that astronomers could not see.\nThe stars and galaxies, were moving as if immersed in the\ngravity of giant invisible clouds of so-called dark matter\n- \"missing matter\" the Swiss astronomer Dr. Fritz Zwicky\nlabeled it in the 1930's. \n\nMany galaxies, for example, are rotating so fast that they\nwould fly apart unless they were being reined in by the\ngravity of halos of dark matter, according to pioneering\nobservations by Dr. Vera Rubin of the Carnegie Institution\nof Washington and her colleagues. Her measurements\nindicated that these dark halos outweighed the visible\ngalaxies themselves from 5 to 10 times. But there could be\neven more dark matter farther out in space, perhaps enough\nto stop the expansion of the universe, eventually, some\ntheorists suggested. Luminous matter, the Darth Vaders of\nthe sky said, is like the snow on mountaintops. \n\nBut what is the dark matter? While some of it is gas or\ndark dim objects like stars and planets, cosmologists\nspeculate that most of it is subatomic particles left over\nfrom the Big Bang. \n\nMany varieties of these particles are predicted by theories\nof high-energy physics. But their existence has not been\nconfirmed or detected in particle accelerators. \n\n\"We theorists can invent all sorts of garbage to fill the\nuniverse,\" Dr. Sheldon Glashow, a Harvard physicist and\nNobel laureate, told a gathering on dark matter in 1981. \n\nCollectively known as WIMP's, for weakly interacting\nmassive particles, such particles would not respond to\nelectromagnetism, the force responsible for light, and thus\nwould be unable to radiate or reflect light. They would\nalso be relatively slow-moving, or \"cold\" in physics\njargon, and thus also go by the name of cold dark matter. \n\nAs Earth in its travels passed through the dark-matter\ncloud that presumably envelops the Milky Way, the particles\nwould shoot through our bodies, rarely leaving a trace,\nlike moonlight through a window. \n\nBut the collective gravity of such particles, cosmologists\nsay, would shape the cosmos and its contents. \n\nGathering along the fault lines laid down by random\nperturbations of density in the early universe, dark matter\nwould congeal into clouds with about the mass of 100,000\nSuns. The ordinary matter that was mixed in with it would\ncool and fall to the centers of the clouds and light up as\nstars. \n\nThe clouds would then attract other clouds. Through a\nseries of mergers over billions of years, smaller clouds\nwould assemble into galaxies, and the galaxies would then\nassemble themselves into clusters of thousands of galaxies,\nand so forth. \n\nUsing the Hubble and other telescopes as time machines -\nlight travels at a finite speed, so the farther out\nastronomers look the farther back in time they see -\ncosmologists have begun to confirm that the universe did\nassemble itself from the \"bottom up,\" as the dark matter\nmodel predicts. \n\nLast year, two teams of astronomers reported seeing the\nfirst stars burning their way out of the cloudy aftermath\nof the Big Bang, when the universe was only 900 million\nyears old. The bulk of galaxy formation occurred when the\nuniverse was a half to a quarter its present age,\ncosmologists say. \n\n\"The big news in the last decade is that even half a\nuniverse ago the universe looked pretty different,\" said\nDr. Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories in\nPasadena. Galaxies before then were small and irregular,\nwith no sign of the majestic spiral spider webs that\ndecorate the sky today. \n\nWe would barely recognize our own Milky Way galaxy, if we\ncould see it five billion years ago when the Sun formed, he\nsaid. \n\n\"By eight billion years back, it would be unrecognizable,\"\nsaid Dr. Dressler. \n\nYet there are still many questions that the cold dark\nmatter model does not answer. Astronomers still do not\nknow, for example, how the first stars formed or why the\nmodels of dark matter distribution don't quite fit in the\ncores of some kinds of galaxies. Nor have the dark matter\nparticles themselves been unambiguously detected or\nidentified, despite continuing experiments. \n\nSome astronomers suggest that the discrepancies stem from\nthe inability of simple mathematical models to deal with\nmessy details of the real world. \n\n\"It's a huge mystery exactly how stars form,\" Dr. Richard\nBond of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics\nsaid. \"We can't solve it now. So it's even harder to try to\nsolve them back then.\" \n\nBut others, notably Dr. Mordehai Milgrom, a theorist at the\nWeizmann Institute in Israel, have suggested that modifying\nthe gravitational laws by which dark matter was deduced in\nthe first place would alleviate the need for dark matter\naltogether. \n\nThe Bang's Fuel \n\nInflating One Ounce \nTo a Whole Universe \n\n\nClues to what had actually exploded\nin the Big Bang emerged as an unexpected gift from another\ngreat scientific quest: physicists' pursuit for a so-called\ntheory of everything that would unite all physical\nphenomena in a single equation. Unable to build machines\npowerful enough to test their most ambitious notions on\nEarth, some theorists turned to the sky. \n\n\"The Big Bang is the poor man's particle accelerator,\" Dr.\nJakob Zeldovich, an influential Russian cosmologist, said. \n\nPhysicists recognize four forces at work in the world\ntoday - gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak\nnuclear forces. But they suspect, based on data from\nparticle accelerators and high-powered theory, that those\nare simply different manifestations of a single unified\nforce that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest\nmoments. \n\nAs the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was\na fall from grace, and the laws of physics evolved, with\none force after another \"freezing out,\" or splitting away. \n\nIn 1979, Dr. Alan Guth, now at the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology, realized that a hypothesized glitch in this\nprocess would have had drastic consequences for the\nuniverse. Under some circumstances, a glass of water can\nstay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,\nuntil it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly\nfreeze, releasing latent heat in the process. Similarly,\nthe universe could \"supercool\" and stay in a unified state\ntoo long. In that case, space itself would become\ntemporarily imbued with a mysterious kind of latent heat,\nor energy. \n\nInserted into Einstein's equations, the latent energy would\nact as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow\nitself apart, Dr. Guth discovered in a calculation in 1979.\n\n\nIn far less than the blink of an eye, 10-37 second, a speck\nmuch smaller than a proton would have swollen to the size\nof a grapefruit and then resumed its more stately\nexpansion, with all of normal cosmic history before it,\nresulting in today's observable universe - a patch of sky\nand stars 14 billion light-years across. All, by the\nmagical-seeming logic of Einstein's equations, from about\nan ounce of primordial stuff. \n\n\"The universe,\" Dr. Guth liked to say, \"might be the\nultimate free lunch.\" \n\nDr. Guth called his theory inflation. Inflation, as Dr.\nGuth pointed out, explains why the universe is expanding.\nDr. Turner of the University of Chicago referred to it as\n\"the dynamite behind the Big Bang.\" \n\nAs modified and improved by Dr. Andrei Linde, now at\nStanford, and by Dr. Paul Steinhardt, now at Princeton and\nDr. Andreas Albrecht now at the University of California at\nDavis, inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology ever\nsince. One of its great virtues, cosmologists say, is that\ninflation explains the origin of galaxies, the main\ncitizens of the cosmos. The answer comes from the\nparadoxical-sounding quantum rules that govern subatomic\naffairs. On the smallest scales, according to quantum\ntheory, nature is lumpy, emitting even energy in little\nbits and subject to an irreducible randomness. As a result,\nso-called quantum fluctuations would leave faint lumps in\nthe early universe. These would serve as the gravitational\nseeds for future galaxies and other cosmic structures. \n\nAs a result of such successes, cosmologists have stuck with\nthe idea of inflation, even though, lacking the ability to\ntest their theories at the high energies of the Big Bang,\nthey have no precise theory about what might have actually\ncaused it. \"Inflation is actually a class of theories,\"\nsaid Dr. Guth. \n\nIn the latest version, called \"chaotic inflation,\" Dr.\nLinde has argued that quantum fluctuations in a myriad of\ntheorized force fields could have done the trick. \n\nIndeed, he and others now say they believe that inflation\ncan occur over and over, spawning an endless chain of\nuniverses out of one another, like bubbles within bubbles. \n\n\"The universe inflates on top of itself,\" Dr. Linde told a\nphysics conference this spring in Princeton. \"It's\nhappening right now.\" \n\nThe Golden Age \n\nNew Devices Detect \nPrimordial Glow \nIf the inflationary\ntheorists are right, the universe we see, the 14 billion\nlight-years, is just a tiny piece of a much vaster\nuniverse, or even a whole ensemble of them, forever out of\nour view. \n\nAccording to the theory, therefore, our own little patch of\nthe cosmos should appear geometrically \"flat,\" the way a\nsection of a balloon looks flat when viewed close up. This\nwas the universe long thought to be the most beautiful and\nsimple. \n\nBut it required, by the logic of Einstein's general\nrelativity, that there be much more dark matter, or\nsomething, to the universe, enough to \"flatten\" space-time,\nthan astronomers had found. \n\nIn fact, this prescription was so hard to reconcile with\nother observations, of galaxies and their evolutions, that\nby 1991 some astronomers and press reports suggested that\nthe entire theoretical edifice of inflation to blow up the\nuniverse and cold dark matter to fill it, not to say the\nBig Bang itself, might have to be junked. \n\nSo it was with a sigh of relief that cosmologists greeted\nthe announcement in April 1992 that NASA's Cosmic\nBackground Explorer, or COBE, satellite had succeeded in\ndiscerning faint blotches in the primordial cosmic radio\nglow. \n\nThese were the seeds from which, inflation predicted, large\ncosmic structures would eventually grow. \n\n\"If you're religious, it's like seeing God,\" said Dr.\nGeorge Smoot, a physicist from the Lawrence Berkeley\nNational Laboratory who led the COBE team. \n\nAstronomers say COBE signaled a transition in which heroic\nideas about the universe began to be replaced by heroic\ndata, as long-planned new telescopes and other instruments\nwent into operation. \n\nA year later, skywalking astronauts corrected the Hubble\ntelescope's myopic vision. The cosmic background radiation\nhas come in for particular scrutiny from new radio\ntelescopes mounted in balloons and on mountaintops. The\nnews has been good, though not decisive, for inflation. \n\nFor three years, a series of increasingly high-resolution\nobservations has confirmed that the pattern of blotches\nstippling the remnant of the primordial fireball is\nconsistent with the predictions from inflation and cold\ndark matter. The instruments have now mapped details small\nenough to have been the seeds of modern clusters of\ngalaxies. \n\n\"I'm completely snowed by the cosmic background radiation,\"\nDr. Guth said. \"The signal was so weak it wasn't even\ndetected until 1965, and now they're measuring fluctuations\nof one part in 100,000.\" \n\nPerhaps most important, the analysis of the fluctuations\nindicates that the universe has a \"flat\" geometry, as\npredicted by inflation. That was a triumph. Although\nobservations could not prove that inflation was right, a\nnonflat universe would have been a blow to the theory, and\nto cosmological orthodoxy. \n\n\"Inflation, our boldest and most promising theory of the\nearliest moments of creation, passed its first very\nimportant test,\" Dr. Turner said at the time. \n\nThe most precise measurements of the cosmic background, at\nleast in the near future, are generally expected to come\nlate this year from NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Project, or\nMAP, satellite, which was launched into space last year on\nJune 30. MAP will be followed by the European Space\nAgency's Planck satellite, in 2006. \n\nIt is highly unlikely that MAP or Planck will be able to\ndetect what Dr. Turner calls \"the smoking gun signature of\ninflation.\" The violent stretching of the universe should\nroil space-time with so-called gravitational waves that\nwould leave a faint imprint on the cosmic fireball. \n\nDetecting those waves would not only confirm inflation, but\nalso might help scientists establish what caused the\ninflation in the first place, giving science its first look\nat the strange physics that prevailed when creation was\nonly about a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of\na second old. \n\nThe Universe's Fate \n\nBleak Implications \nOf `Dark Energy' \n\nIn 1998, two competing teams of\nastronomers startled the scientific world with the news\nthat the expansion of the universe seemed to be speeding up\nunder the influence of a mysterious antigravity that seems\nembedded in space itself and that is hauntingly reminiscent\nof Einstein's old, presumably discredited, cosmological\nconstant. \n\n\"Dark energy,\" the phenomenon was quickly named. \n\nIf dark\nenergy is real and the acceleration continues, the galaxies\nwill eventually speed away from one another so quickly that\nthey couldn't see one another. The universe would become\ncold and empty as the continued acceleration sucked away\nthe energy needed for life and thought. \n\nIt would be \"the worst possible universe,\" for the quality\nand quantity of life, said Dr. Lawrence Krauss, a physicist\nat Case Western Reserve University. \n\nDr. Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in\nPrinceton, called the discovery of dark energy \"the\nstrangest experimental finding since I've been in physics.\"\n\n\nThe discovery was a surprise to the astronomers involved.\nNeither team had expected to find the universe\naccelerating. They had each set out to measure by how much\nthe expansion of the universe was slowing because of the\ngravity of its contents and thus settle the question of its\nfate. \n\nOne team was led by Dr. Saul Perlmutter, a physicist at\nLawrence Berkeley. The other team was a band of astronomers\nled by Dr. Brian Schmidt of Mount Stromlo and the Siding\nSpring Observatory in Australia. \n\nEach group employed far-flung networks of telescopes,\nincluding the Hubble, and the Internet to find and monitor\ncertain exploding stars, or supernovas, as cosmic beacons.\nSuch explosions, the death rattles of massive stars, are\npowerful enough to be seen clear across the universe when\nthe universe was younger and, presumably, expanding faster.\n\n\nLeapfrogging each other across the universe, the two teams,\npropitiously for their credibility, arrived at the same\nanswer at the same time: the cosmos was not slowing at all;\nit was speeding up. \n\nDr. Perlmutter, who had once resented the competition,\nconceded, \"With only one group, it would have been a lot\nharder to get the community to buy into such a surprising\nresult.\" \n\n\"This was a very strange result,\" said Dr. Adam Riess, a\nmember of Dr. Schmidt's team. \"It was the opposite of what\nwe thought we were doing.\" \n\nThe results have sent Einstein's old cosmological constant\nto the forefront of cosmology. Despite his disavowal, the\nconstant had never really gone away and had in fact been\ngiven new life by quantum physics. Einstein had famously\nrejected quantum's randomness, saying God didn't play dice.\n\n\nBut it justified, in retrospect, his fudge factor. \n\nAccording to the uncertainty principle, a pillar of quantum\ntheory, empty space was not empty, but rather foaming with\nthe energy of so-called virtual particles as they flashed\nin and out of existence on borrowed energy. This so-called\nvacuum energy could repel, just like Einstein's old\ncosmological constant, or attract. \n\nThe case for dark energy got even stronger a year later,\nwhen the cosmic background observations reported evidence\nof a flat universe. Because astronomers had been able to\nfind only about a third as much matter, both dark and\nluminous, as was needed by Einstein's laws to create a flat\ngeometry, something else had to be adding to it. \n\nThe discovery of dark energy exemplified Dr. Zeldovich's\nview of the universe as the poor man's particle\naccelerator, and it caught the physicists flat-footed,\nsomewhat to the pride of the astronomers. \n\n\"A coming of age of astronomy,\" Dr. Dressler called it.\n\n\nWhat is dark energy? The question now hangs over the\nuniverse. \n\nIs it really Einstein's old fudge factor returned to haunt\nhis children? In that case, as the universe expands and the\nvolume of space increases, astronomers say, the push\nbecause of dark energy will also increase, accelerating the\ngalaxies away from one another faster and faster, leading\nto a dire dark future. \n\nOther physicists, however, have pointed out that the\ntheories of modern physics are replete with mysterious\nforce fields, collectively called \"quintessence,\" that\nmight or might not exist, but that could temporarily\nproduce negative gravity and mimic the action of a\ncosmological constant. In that case, all bets on the future\nare off. The universe could accelerate and then decelerate,\nor vice versa as the dark energy fields rose or fell. \n\nA third possibility is that dark energy does not exist at\nall, in which case not just the future, but the whole\ncarefully constructed jigsaw puzzle of cosmology, might be\nin doubt. The effects of cosmic acceleration could be\nmimicked, astronomers say, by unusual dust in the far\nuniverse or by unsuspected changes in the characteristics\nof supernovas over cosmic time. As a result, more groups\nare joining the original two teams in the hunt for new\nsupernovas and other ways to measure the effects of dark\nenergy on the history of the universe. \n\nDr. Perlmutter has proposed building a special satellite\ntelescope, the Supernova Astronomy Project, to investigate\nexactly when and how abruptly the cosmic acceleration\nkicked in. \n\nThe Nagging QuestionsA Grand Synthesis, \nBut Hardly Complete \nFor all the new answers being\nharvested, some old questions linger, and they have now\nbeen joined by new ones. \n\nA flat universe is the most mathematically appealing\nsolution of Einstein's equations, cosmologists agree. But\nthey are puzzled by the specific recipe, large helpings of\ndark matter and dark energy, that nature has chosen. Dr.\nTurner called it \"a preposterous universe.\" \n\nBut Dr. Martin Rees, a Cambridge University cosmologist,\nsaid that the discovery of a deeper principle governing the\nuniverse and, perhaps, life, may alter our view of what is\nfundamental. Some features of the universe that are now\nconsidered fundamental - like the exact mixture of dark\nmatter, dark energy and regular stuff in the cosmos - may\nturn out to be mere accidents of evolution in one out of\nthe many, many universes allowed by eternal inflation. \n\n\"If we had a theory, then we would know whether there were\nmany big bangs or one,\" Dr. Rees said. The answers to these\nand other questions, many scientists suspect, have to await\nthe final unification of physics, a theory that reconciles\nEinstein's relativity, which describes the shape of the\nuniverse, to the quantum chaos that lives inside it. \n\nSuch a theory, quantum gravity, is needed to describe the\nfirst few moments of the universe, when it was so small\nthat even space and time should become fuzzy and\ndiscontinuous. \n\nFor two decades, many physicists have placed their bets for\nquantum gravity on string theory, which posits that\nelementary particles are tiny strings vibrating in a 10- or\n11-dimensional space. Each kind of particle, in a sense,\ncorresponds to a different note on the string. \n\nIn principle, string theory can explain all the forces of\nnature. But even its adherents concede that their equations\nare just approximations to an unknown theory that they call\nM-theory, with \"M\" standing for matrix, magic, mystery or\neven mother, as in \"mother of all theories.\" Moreover, the\neffects of \"stringy physics\" are only evident at energies\nforever beyond the limits of particle accelerators. \n\nSome string theorists have ventured into cosmology, hoping,\nto discover some effect that would show up in the poor\nman's particle accelerator, the sky. \n\nIn addition to strings, the theory also includes membranes,\nor \"branes,\" of various dimensions. Our universe can be\nenvisioned as such a brane floating in higher-dimensional\nspace like a leaf in a fish tank, perhaps with other brane\nuniverses nearby. These branes could interact\ngravitationally or even collide, setting off the Big Bang. \n\nIn one version suggested last year by four cosmologists\nled by Dr. Steinhardt of Princeton, another brane would\nrepeatedly collide with our own. They pass back and forth\nthrough each other, causing our universe to undergo an\neternal chain of big bangs. \n\nSuch notions are probably the future for those who are paid\nto wonder about the universe. \n\nAnd the fruits of this work could yet cause cosmologists to\nreconsider their new consensus, warned Dr. Peebles of\nPrinceton, who has often acted as the conscience of the\ncosmological community, trying to put the brakes on faddish\ntrends. \n\nHe wonders whether the situation today can be compared to\nanother historical era, around 1900, when many people\nthought that physics was essentially finished and when the\nEnglish physicist Lord Kelvin said that just a couple of\n\"clouds\" remained to be dealt with. \n\n\"A few annoying tidbits, which turned out to be relativity\nand quantum theory,\" the twin revolutions of 20th-century\nscience, Dr. Peebles said. \n\nLikewise, there are a few clouds today like what he called\n\"the dark sector,\" which could have more complicated\nphysics than cosmologists think. \n\n\"I'm not convinced these clouds herald revolutions as deep\nas relativity and quantum mechanics,\" Dr. Peebles said.\n\"I'm not arguing that they won't.\" \n\nAs for the fate of the universe, we will never have a firm\nanswer, said Dr. Sandage, who was Hubble's prot�g� and has\nseen it all. \n\n\"It's like asking, `Does God exist?' \" he said.\n\n\nPredicting the future, he pointed out, requires faith that\nsimple mathematical models really work to describe the\nuniverse. \n\n\"I don't think we really know how things work,\" he said.\n\n\nAlthough Dr. Sandage does not buy into all aspects of the\nemerging orthodoxy, he said it was a fantastic time to be\nalive. \n\n\"It's all working toward a much grander synthesis than we\ncould have imagined 100 years ago,\" he said. \"I think this\nis the most exciting life I could have had.\"\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/23/science/space/23UNIV.html?ex=1028416223&ei=1&en=ff38ea5fac0c9158\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
