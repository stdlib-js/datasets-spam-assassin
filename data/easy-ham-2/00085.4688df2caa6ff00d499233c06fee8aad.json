So I\nreally have no idea what they claim they've patented - doin DCT\non 8x8 blocks of an image, quantising the resulting coefficients,\nor DCT in general?

They're all very different compression\nalgorithms.\n\nAnyway, here's to ogg, and hopefully the future mpeg4-standard\ncompression algorithm the project comes up with (fingers\ncrossed). And I wouldn't worry about the jpeg thing - in addition\nthe patent runs out next year, and I would suggest that having\nfailed to protect their IP for 15 years, as (iirc) is their\nresponsibility, their claim would probably never hold up in\ncourt.\n\nCheers,\nDave.\n\n-- \n       David Neary,\n    Marseille, France\n  E-Mail: bolsh@gimp.org\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
