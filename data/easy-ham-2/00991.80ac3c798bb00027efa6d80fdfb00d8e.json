The more\ndifficult case are those whose back-end business\ncan be executed entirely in a foreign nation, such\nas the 419 spammers. And you're right: there's not\nmuch we can do about those, except filter them in\nvarious ways. But the vast majority of spammers\nhave a back-end business that requires a native\npresence. Debt consolidation. Mortgages. Herbalife\nand other MLMs. Even porn sites require credit\ncard transactions. That means the people responsible\nCAN be found.\n\n>I don't know of any law that specifically /exempts/ them from lawsuits, \n>it's just that no one has yet succeeded in any important way.\n\nThere have been some successful suits, but (a) it\ntakes too much effort, and (b) the result isn't enough\nto deter the spammer. But you're talking about action\nconstrained by law. In an anarchy, people act more\ndirectly, with less cost, and to more effect. Spammers\nvery quickly would learn their lesson. Except for the\nones who ply their scam in a foreign country.\n\nOf course, that's assuming there are ISPs and other\ninfrastructure in an anarchy. Arguing about how things\nwould work without the state involves a large degree\nof counterfactual reasoning.\n\n>no lawmaker has ever been even a tenth the catalyst on improving the \n>quality of life in Britain and the western world as did central heating and \n>the invention of one A.J.Crapper.\n\nHmm. I've lived most of my life in houses that did\nnot have central heating, including my current abode.\nAs to the crapper, it did not do nearly as much to\nimprove waste management in cities as did the public\nsewers which it feeds, and the water lines that supply\nit. Without these, you would find that a chamber pot\nworks just as well.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \nhttp://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
