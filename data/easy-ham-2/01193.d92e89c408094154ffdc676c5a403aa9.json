It does seem that with 7.3 something rather extraordinary has \nhappened! And while there are rpms for plib (as in plib.sf.net), TuxRacer, \nFlightGear and so on (for SuSE, Mandy and Connectiva, IIRC) dotted around, \nthere are none for 7.3. \n\nCheers\n\nJohn\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
