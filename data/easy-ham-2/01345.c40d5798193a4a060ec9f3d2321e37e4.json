BUGTRAQ SUMMARY\n-------------------\n1. OpenSSL SSLv2 Malformed Client Key Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5363\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5363\nSummary:\n\nOpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used\nby a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,\nSendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based\nsystems.\n\nA buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in some versions of\nOpenSSL.\n\nWhen initiating an OpenSSL session, some information is shared between the\nclient and the server, including key data. The reported vulnerability lies\nin the handling of the client key value during the negotiation of the\nSSLv2 protocol.\n\nA malicious client may exploit this vulnerability by transmitting a\nmalformed key to the vulnerable server. Careful exploitation may result in\nexecution of arbitrary code as the server process, and the attacker\ngaining local access to the vulnerable system. More primitive attacks may\nresult in the server process crashing, possibly producing a denial of\nservice condition.\n\nThe consequences of exploitation may vary with the nature of the\napplication using OpenSSL.\n\nOracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable\nunder Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.\n\n** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL\nBuffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate\nvulnerability.\n\n2. Abyss Web Server HTTP GET Request Directory Contents Disclosure Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5345\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5345\nSummary:\n\nAbyss Web Server is a freely available personal web server. It is\nmaintained by Aprelium Technologies and runs on Microsoft Windows\noperating systems, as well as Linux.\n\nA vulnerability has been reported for Abyss Web Server 1.0.3 running on a\nMicrosoft Windows platform. It is possible for an attacker to make a\nrequest such that the contents of the specified directory are revealed.\n\nThe vulnerability occurs due to the manner in which excessive '/'\ncharacters are handled in web requests. An attacker making a GET request\nfollowed by 256 '/' characters will cause Abyss Web Server to return an\nerror page containing the directory listing of the specified directory.\n\nAn attacker may be able to use this information to launch further,\npotentially damaging attacks, against a vulnerable system.\n\n3. DotProject User Cookie Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5347\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5347\nSummary:\n\ndotproject is web-based project management software, written in PHP.  It\nis designed to run on Unix and Linux variants.\n\ndotproject is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to bypass\nauthentication and gain administrative access to the software.\n\nThis may be accomplished by submitting a maliciously crafted 'user_cookie'\nvalue either manually or via manipulation of URI parameters.  For example,\nthe attacker may manually craft a cookie with a 'user_cookie' value of 1\nand submit it to the project management system.  An attacker may also\nsubmit a malicious web request with the 'user_cookie' URI parameter set to\n1.  In both instances, the attacker will gain administrative access to the\nproject management system.\n\nThis problem is due to the software relying on the 'user_cookie' value to\nauthenticate the user.\n\n4. OpenSSL SSLv3 Session ID Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5362\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5362\nSummary:\n\nOpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used\nby a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,\nSendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based\nsystems.\n\nA vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL. The vulnerability affects\nSSLv3 session IDs.\n\nWhen initiating contact with SSLv3 servers, clients and servers alike\nexchange information. Session information is stored in a session key with\na unique session ID.\n\nReportedly when a an oversized SSL version 3 session ID is supplied to a\nclient from a malicious server, it is possible to overflow a buffer on the\nremote system. This could result in key memory areas on the vulnerable,\nremote system being overwritten, including stack frame data.\n\nAn attacker may be able to take advantage of this vulnerability to execute\nmalicious code on a vulnerable SSLv3 client machine.\n\nOracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable\nunder Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.\n\n** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL\nBuffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate\nvulnerability.\n\n5. phpBB2 Gender Mod Remote SQL Injection Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5342\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5342\nSummary:\n\nphpBB2 is an open-source web forum application that is written in PHP and\nbackended by a number of database products. It will run on most Unix and\nLinux variants, as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.\n\nGender Mod is a modification for phpBB2 which allows the association of a\ngender with a given user profile. A SQL injection vulnerability has been\nreported in this mod.\n\nA malicious user may modify the specified value for 'gender' when updating\ntheir profile. It is possible to include additional SQL statements in this\nstring, and subvert the SQL statement used to update the user profile.\n\nIt has been reported possible to gain administrative access to the phpBB2\nsite through exploitation of this issue. Other attacks may be possible,\nincluding the ability to view sensitive database information or to modify\nadditional information stored in the database.\n\n6. ShoutBox Form Field HTML Injection Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5354\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5354\nSummary:\n\nshoutBOX is web-based user feedback software.  It is written in PHP and\nruns on Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating\nsystems.\n\nShoutBox does not sufficiently sanitize HTML tags from input supplied via\nform fields.  In particular, the user website URL field of the feedback\nform is not sanitized of HTML tags.\n\nAttackers may exploit this lack of input validation to inject arbitrary\nHTML and script code into pages that are generated by the script.  This\nmay result in execution of attacker-supplied code in the web client of a\nuser who visits such a page.  HTML and script code will be executed in the\nsecurity context of the site hosting the software.\n\nThis condition may be exploited to hijack web content or potentially steal\ncookie-based authentication credentials.\n\n7. Sympoll File Disclosure Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5360\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5360\nSummary:\n\nSympoll is web-based voting booth software.  It is implemented in PHP and\nwill run on most Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows\noperating systems.\n\nSympoll is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to disclose\nthe contents of arbitrary webserver readable files.  This vulnerability is\nonly present on hosts which are running the vulnerable version of the\nsoftware and have the PHP 'register_globals' directive enabled.  The\nsource of this vulnerability is reported to be insufficient integrity\nchecking of variables.\n\nThe vendor has stated that this issue is only believed to affect Sympoll\nversion 1.2.\n\nExploitation of this issue on Microsoft Windows operating systems may\npotentially expose arbitrary system files since webservers typically run\nin the SYSTEM context.\n\n8. OpenSSL ASN.1 Parsing Error Denial Of Service Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5366\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5366\nSummary:\n\nOpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is used\nby a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,\nSendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based\nsystems.\n\nA remotely exploitable denial of service condition has been reported in\nthe OpenSSL ASN.1 library.\n\nThis vulnerability is due to parsing errors and affects SSL, TLS, S/MIME,\nPKCS#7 and certificate creation routines.  In particular, malformed\ncertificate encodings could cause a denial of service to server and client\nimplementations which depend on OpenSSL.\n\nOracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable\nunder Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.\n\n** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL\nBuffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate\nvulnerability.\n\n9. William Deich Super SysLog Format String Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5367\nRemote: No\nDate Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5367\nSummary:\n\nsuper is an open source set-uid root utility that allows for a similar\nfunctionality to that of the sudo utility. It is written for use on Linux\nand Unix variant operating systems.\n\nsuper is prone to a format string vulnerability. This problem is due to\nincorrect use of the syslog() function to log error messages. It is\npossible to corrupt memory by passing format strings through the\nvulnerable logging function. This may potentially be exploited to\noverwrite arbitrary locations in memory with attacker-specified values.\n\nThe vulnerability is a result of compiling super with syslog support. Due\nto an error in the file, error.c, users that are not in the super\nconfiguration file will still be able to execute code with root\nprivileges.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this issue may allow the attacker to execute\narbitrary instructions with root privileges.\n\n10. Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload Plain Text Password Storage Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5369\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5369\nSummary:\n\nFrederic Tyndiuk Eupload is a small script designed to facilitate\nuploading of files to a remote server. It is written in Perl and should\nwork with Microsoft Windows and Linux and Unix variant operating systems.\n\nA problem with Eupload 1.0 may make it possible for remote attackers to\ngain access to sensitive information.\n\nEupload does not cryptographically protect stored passwords. Passwords\ncontained in the configuration file, password.txt, are stored in plain\ntext. They may be read by simply viewing the file. The file, password.txt,\nis stored in a web accessible location and is, itself, accessible for\nretrieval. Thus it is trivial for an attacker to obtain user passwords and\nabuse the Eupload service.\n\nThis problem could allow an attacker to gain access to the passwords to\nprotected resources.\n\n11. Util-linux File Locking Race Condition Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5344\nRemote: No\nDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5344\nSummary:\n\nThe util-linux package is a set of commonly used system utilities such as\n'chfn' and 'chsh'.  It is included with many Linux distributions.\n\nA race condition has been reported in code shared by the util-linux\nutilities.  The condition is related to file locking.  Failure to check\nfor the existence of a lockfile prior to sensitive operations may, under\nspecific circumstances, open a window of opportunity for attack.  The\nutil-linux utilities often write to sensitive files such as /etc/passwd/.\nAttackers may exploit the condition to inject arbitrary data into these\nfiles to elevate privileges.\n\nThe reported attacks are complex, time dependent and require specific\ncircumstances such as system administrator interaction and a large passwd\nfile.\n\nRed Hat Linux is known to ship with util-linux as a core component.\nOther distributions, those that are derived from Red Hat in particular,\nmay also be vulnerable.\n\nIt should be noted that the utilities included with the shadow-utils\npackage (shipped with SuSE Linux) are not vulnerable.\n\n12. OpenSSL Kerberos Enabled SSLv3 Master Key Exchange Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5361\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5361\nSummary:\n\nOpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used\nby a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,\nSendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based\nsystems.\n\nA vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL 0.9.7 pre-release versions.\n\nThis vulnerability is present only when Kerberos is enabled for a system\nusing SSL version 3.\n\nWhen initiatiating contact between a SSLv3 server, master keys are\nexchanged between the client and the server. When an oversized master key\nis supplied to a SSL version 3 server by a malicious client, it may cause\na buffer to overflow on the vulnerable system. As a result, stack memory\non the vulnerable server will become corrupted. This could enable the\nattacker to take control of the SSLv3 server process and cause it to\nexecute malicious, attacker supplied code.\n\n** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL\nBuffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate\nvulnerability.\n\n13. OpenSSL ASCII Representation Of Integers Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5364\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5364\nSummary:\n\nOpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is used\nby a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,\nSendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based\nsystems.\n\nRemotely exploitable buffer overflow conditions have been reported in\nOpenSSL.  This issue is due to insufficient checking of bounds with\nregards to ASCII representations of integers on 64 bit platforms.  It is\npossible to overflow these buffers on a vulnerable system if overly large\nvalues are submitted by a malicious attacker.\n\nExploitation of this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the vulnerable application, service or client.\n\nOracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable\nunder Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.\n\n** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL\nBuffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate\nvulnerability.\n\n14. ParaChat Phantom User Denial Of Service Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5370\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5370\nSummary:\n\nParaChat is a web-based chatting system.  It is available for most Unix\nand Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.\n\nParaChat chat servers are prone to a denial of service condition.\n\nIf a user has left the webpage for a chat room using the Back or Forward\nbuttons of their browser in lieu of logging out, their account will still\nbe logged into the chat room until it times out 15 minutes later.  A\nmalicious user may do this repeatedly as different users to overload the\nchat server with \"phantom\" users.  A denial of service may be the result.\n\n15. OpenSSH Trojan Horse Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5374\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Aug 01 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5374\nSummary:\n\nOpenSSH is a freely available implementation of the SSH client-server\nprotocol. It is distributed and maintained by the OpenSSH team.\n\nReportedly, the server hosting openssh, ftp.openbsd.org, was compromised\nrecently. It has been reported that the intruder made modifications to the\nsource code of openssh to include trojan horse code. Downloads of the\nopenssh source code from ftp.openbsd.org between July 30, 2002 and July\n31, 2002 likely contain the trojan code.\n\nThe trojan code appears to be included in the file, bf-test.c. Reports say\nthat the trojan will run once upon compilation of openssh. The trojan\nprocess is named 'sh' or the compiling user's default shell. Once executed\nthe trojan attempts to connect to 203.62.158.32 on port 6667. The trojan\nwill then wait for one of three commands. A connection to the specified\naddress is attempted once every hour.\n\n'D' will cause the trojan to execute '/bin/sh'. 'M' will cause the trojan\nto respawn and 'A' will terminate the trojan process. It is highly\nprobable that this trojan will give remote root access to vulnerable\nsystems.\n\nThe following sites also have been reported to carry the trojaned version of openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz:\nftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/\nftp://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/\nftp://ftp1.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/\n\nIt is not known whether other sites are affected as well.\n\nFreeBSD has reported the following MD5 checksum information. The following\nis the MD5 checksum of the trojaned version of openssh: MD5\n(openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 3ac9bc346d736b4a51d676faa2a08a57\n\nThe following is the MD5 checksum of openssh in the FreeBSD ports\ndirectory: MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 459c1d0262e939d6432f193c7a4ba8a8\n\nNote that a different checksum does not mean the backdoor does not exist.\n\n*** The OpenSSH team has released an advisory. Fixed versions of openssh\nare available for download since 1300 UTC August 1, 2002. The following\nMD5 checksum information was provided for fixed versions of openssh:\n\nMD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 459c1d0262e939d6432f193c7a4ba8a8\nMD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz.sig) = d5a956263287e7fd261528bb1962f24c\nMD5 (openssh-3.4.tgz) = 39659226ff5b0d16d0290b21f67c46f2\nMD5 (openssh-3.2.2p1.tar.gz) = 9d3e1e31e8d6cdbfa3036cb183aa4a01\nMD5 (openssh-3.2.2p1.tar.gz.sig) = be4f9ed8da1735efd770dc8fa2bb808a\n\n16. Bharat Mediratta Gallery Remote File Include Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5375\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Aug 01 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5375\nSummary:\n\nGallery is an open source web based photo album. It is written in PHP and\nis available for Linux and Unix variant as well as Microsoft Windows\noperating systems.\n\nGallery is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to include\narbitrary files located on remote servers. This issue is present in the\nfollowing PHP script files provided with Gallery: errors/configmode.php\nerrors/needinit.php errors/reconfigure.php errors/unconfigured.php\ncaptionator.php\n\nAn attacker may exploit this by supplying a path to a file, 'init.php', on\na remote host as a value for the 'GALLERY_BASEDIR' parameter.\n\nIf the remote file is a PHP script, this may allow for execution of\nattacker-supplied PHP code with the privileges of the webserver.\nSuccessful exploitation may provide local access to the attacker.\n\n17. John G. Myers MUnpack Malformed MIME Encoded Message Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5385\nRemote: No\nDate Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5385\nSummary:\n\nJohn G. Myers mpack/munpack is a pair of utilities to encode and decode\nMIME format email. Versions are available for Linux and Unix variant\noperating systems as well as Microsoft DOS.\n\nA buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported for munpack 1.5.\nReportedly, it is possible to cause munpack to crash when it receives a\nmalformed email or NNTP news article.\n\nAs this vulnerability is the result of a buffer overflow condition, it may\nbe possible for an attacker to cause munpack to execute malicious attacker\nsupplied code. This has not, however, been confirmed.\n\n18. Dispair Remote Command Execution Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5392\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5392\nSummary:\n\nDispair is a web-based .tar.gz archive viewer.  It is written in Perl and\nis available for Linux and Unix operating systems.\n\nDispair fails to sufficiently validate user-supplied input before it is\npassed to the shell via the Perl open() function.  A remote attacker may\nexploit this condition by injecting arbitrary commands into CGI parameters\nin a request to the vulnerable script.\n\nThe result of successful exploitation is that attackers may potentially\nexploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying shell\nwith the privileges of the webserver process.\n\n19. Mailreader Session Hijacking Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5393\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5393\nSummary:\n\nMailreader is an open source project which allows POP3 mail access through\na web interface. Mailreader is implemented in Perl, and should work under\nMicrosoft Windows, Linux and other Unix based operating systems.\n\nA vulnerability has been reported in some versions of Mailreader. It may\nbe possible for a remote attacker to hijack the session of a legitimate\nuser of the system. This may result in access to sensitive information, or\nthe ability to send mail and otherwise function as the legitimate user.\n\nFull exploit details are not available. It is possible that this\nvulnerability results from session information being tracked through CGI\nparameters, which may be trivially spoofed by a remote user. This\npossibility has not, however, been confirmed.\n\n20. John G. Myers MPack/MUnpack Malformed Filename Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5386\nRemote: No\nDate Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5386\nSummary:\n\nJohn G. Myers mpack/munpack is a pair of utilities to encode and decode\nMIME format email. Versions are available for Linux and Unix variant\noperating systems as well as Microsoft DOS.\n\nA vulnerability has been reported for mpack/munpack 1.5. Reportedly, it is\npossible to cause munpack to create files outside of a designated\ndirectory. When mpack/munpack receives a MIME encoded message with an\nattachment that refers to a file, using a '../' sequence followed by the\nfilename, it may decode the attachment outside of a designated directory.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is limited as it has been reported that\nmunpack will only accept a single '../' sequence and will not overwrite\nany existing files.\n\n21. Fake Identd Client Query Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\nBugTraq ID: 5351\nRemote: Yes\nDate Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM\nRelevant URL:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5351\nSummary:\n\nFake Identd is an open source Ident server designed to return the same\ninformation to all incoming requests. It is implemented by Tomi Ollila,\nand available for Linux and a number of other Unix based operating\nsystems.\n\nReportedly, some versions of Fake Identd fail to properly handle long\nclient requests. A specially formatted request split across multiple TCP\npackets may cause an internal buffer to overflow. Reportedly, execution of\narbitrary code as the Fake Identd server process is possible.\n\nFake Identd is designed to drop privileges. However, it has also been\nreported that this behavior is flawed in some versions. As a result,\nexploitation may result in the execution of code with root privileges.\n\n\nIII.
