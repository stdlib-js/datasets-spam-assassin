Briefly, \"iDEFENSE\", which bills\nitself as \"a global security intelligence company\", is offering cash\nfor information about security vulnerabilities in computer software\nthat are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell\nanyone else.\n\nIf this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a\nvery serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.\n\nAt the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research\nknown as \"full disclosure\"; people who discover security\nvulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short\nwhile later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem\n--- they publish the information, including code to exploit the\nvulnerability, if possible.  \n\nThis method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by\nCERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call \"responsible\ndisclosure\" --- never release working exploit code, and never release\nany information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released\na patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers\nvulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked\non features, and often, even after the patches were released, people\nwouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem\nwas.\n\nThe underground computer criminal community would often discover and\nexploit these same holes for months or years while the \"responsible\ndisclosure\" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the\nunderground, vulnerable.\n\nThe problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known\nare much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to\nreduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,\nturning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and\ndetecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less\nuseful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see\nsecurity vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so\nprefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as\nlong as possible.\n\niDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous\nthan either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in\na marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding\ndiscoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  \n\nNot long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently\nincluding some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the\nsecrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software\nvendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to\nHewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if\nHP retained Snosoft's \"consulting services\".  HP considered this\nextortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the\ninformation.\n\nIf this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,\ntogether, add up to a catastrophe.\n\nFirst, secret software vulnerability information will be available to\nthe highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,\nI think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime\nsyndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.\n\nSecond, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will\nbecome lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be\n--- just as in the \"responsible disclosure\" days --- that the good\nguys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority\nof current vulnerabilities are kept secret.\n\nI've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the\nvendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's\nplausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets\nthem, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the\npeople who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when\ncredit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.\nKnowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site\nadministrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some\nnegative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.\n\nI think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability\ninformation is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to\nexecute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that\nmeans organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who\nare good at networked theft may not yet exist.\n\nThere might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as\nMicrosoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR\nthan a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in\nSamba, for example.\n\nRight now, people who know how to find security exploits are either\nmotivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public\ninterest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or\npersonally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating\na marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly\nincrease the availability of that information to the people who can\nafford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.\n\nLet's not let that happen.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the original iDEFENSE announcement:\n\nFrom: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com]\nSent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM\nSubject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program\n\n\nGreetings,\n\niDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability\nContributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance\nnotification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.\n\niDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following\nprovides answers to some basic questions about the program:\n\nQ. How will it work?\nA. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish\nsecurity research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number\nof motivations, including the following:\n\n         * Pure love of security research\n         * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks\n         * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products\n         * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure\n\nThe VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the\nInternet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the\nwork.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following\nitems:\n\n         * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)\n         * The amount of detail and analysis provided\n         * The potential severity level for the information shared\n         * The types of applications, operating systems, and other\n           software and hardware potentially affected\n         * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs\n         * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE\n\nQ. Who should contribute to the VCP?\nA. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other\nentity.\n\nQ. Why are you launching this program?\nA. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions\nto some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More\noften, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the\noriginal contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is\ncompensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the\npublic at large are warned in a timely manner.\n\nQ. Who gets the credit?\nA. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or\nexploit information.\n\nQ. When can I contribute?\nThe VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.\n\nTo learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have\nquestions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please\ncontact us at contributor@idefense.com.\n\nRegards,\n\nSunil James\nTechnical Analyst\niDEFENSE\n\n\"iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively\nmonitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and\nhacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code.\nThe iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers, frontline\nsecurity professionals and network administrators with timely access to\nactionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats.\niDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities, examines\nthe behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new\nsoftware/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment.\"\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
