Also, there is a\nvicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large\ncompany in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some\nkind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having\nimplemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a\nrumour (http://www.weblaw.co.uk/artemail.htm).\n\nAnyway, please: Email exel.com!!!\n\n> kevin\n\nNB: This email is copyright 2002 Paul Jakma.
