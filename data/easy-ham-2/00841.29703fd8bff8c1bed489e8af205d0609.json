Set in the old west.\n\nA cowboy is riding along on his favorite horse when he's suddenly \nsurrounded and taken prison by a band of roaming Indians. The indians \ntake the cowboy and his horse and tell him the traditional way that the \ntribe deals with their victims:\nEach day for the next 3 days, you get a wish. If its in our power to \ngrant it to you, we will. After the 3rd wish is done, you die a horrible \nslow death. Time for your first wish.\n\nThe cowboy thinks a bit, and says \"I want to talk to my horse.\" So the \nindians bring the horse over, the cowboy whispers in his ears, and the \nhorse runs off. A little while later the horse comes back with a \nbeautiful blond naked woman. The cowboy and the woman go in the tent, \nappropriate noises are heard, and then the horse takes the woman away.\n\nThe next day, time for the wish comes, and the Indians, amazed at \nyesterday's performance, all gather round. The cowboy says \"I want to \ntalk to my horse\". So the horse is brought over, the cowboy whispers in \nits ears, and the horse takes off. A little while later the horse comes \nback, with a beautiful brunette, naked, same routine as before, cowboy \nand the women go in the tent, ..., etc.\n\nOn the third and final day, the indians are totally amazed, and are \neager to hear what the cowboy's wish will be. So they all gather round, \nand the cowboy again says \"I want to talk to my horse.\" The horse is \nbrought over, and this time the cowboy grabs the horse by the head, \nstares right at him, and says -- \"Read my lips -- Posse! Posse!\"\nOwen\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
