However, since I couldn't make it \nhappen every single time, I may have just been lucky since I made my change.  \nAt any rate, the change I just made is clearly more correct than what was \nthere before.\n\nLet me know if I'm mistaken.\n\nChris\n\n\n-- \nChris Garrigues                 http://www.DeepEddy.Com/~cwg/\nvirCIO                          http://www.virCIO.Com\n716 Congress, Suite 200\nAustin, TX  78701\t\t+1 512 374 0500\n\n  World War III:  The Wrong-Doers Vs. the Evil-Doers.\n\n\n\n\n--==_Exmh_-2058972181P\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Exmh version 2.2_20000822 06/23/2000\n\niD8DBQE9OIGtK9b4h5R0IUIRAthIAJ4wtss7gIde5srJW7/X8naPwCfakgCbBQ3Z\nDJAuHklXX3TlR8pVjp2LWIA=\n=Dqvl\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n--==_Exmh_-2058972181P--\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n\n"}
