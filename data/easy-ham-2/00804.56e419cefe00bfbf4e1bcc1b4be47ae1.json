If you're into\nPVRs though, Dish just came out with the \"721\" receiver. No monthly\nfee for it (unlike Tivo, etc) and it can record two things at once while\nyou watch a third program previously recorded. Also has 120GB hard drive\nand rumor has it a Broadcom chip in there to support the new encoding\nsystem expected to be put into place a couple years after the merger.\n\n(oh and the 721 is based on Linux if that matters)\n\nBill Humphries wrote:\n> \n> I told AT&T to get lost after they wanted $$$ to change my service address.\n> \n> RCN doesn't service Mountain View, so I'm looking at Dish Network and\n> Direct TV.\n> \n> So far Direct TV appears to be the better deal.\n> \n> Recommendations?
