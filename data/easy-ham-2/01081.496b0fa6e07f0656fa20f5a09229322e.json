The postings they do have are months old\nbait. This is now a completely pointless way to look for a job.\n\n* We're almost flatlne in jobs created for several months, where population\ngrowth needs about 120k jobs a month to keep things steady.\n\n* Unemployment rates are only staying steady becasue people drop out of the\nworkforce number after they cant find a job for a long time. The \"not in\nlabor force\" is rising 400k a month. International numbers are no better -\ntechnology is replacing people, especially the people tha tmake the\ntechnoogy.\n\n* Grad school programs are stuffed full of people for every non-tech major.\nColleges are having big headaches dealing with all the day-job refugees.\n\n* Spam for porn, ink, and stocks has dropped off, spam (the english ones I\nsee subject lines for) now seems to be dominated by work-at-home scams and\nresume services. That's got to be a BAD sign.\n\n* FoRK is now almost all spam, somebody fix the damn subscriber-only-posting\nsetting already, dont make me show up at your house Rohit ;)\n\n- Adam L. \"Duncan\" Beberg\n  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/\n  beberg@mithral.com\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
