(((Oh yeah.  You bet it \ndoes.))) The number of nights when temperatures stay above \n25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit) in Tokyo has doubled over the \nlast 30 years, while average temperatures have shot up by \n2.9 degrees C over the last century. Relief, however \ndistant, could be on the way.  (((\"Great news, weather \nsufferers!  We live in the high-tech capital of a G-7 \nstate!\")))\n\n   \"At the behest of the Construction Ministry, the panel \nhas drawn up a plan that would use a network of buried \npipes, and water pumped from the sea, to cool things down. \n'In the very best conditions, certain areas could in \ntheory become as much as 2.6 degrees Celsius cooler,' said \nYujin Minobe, a ministry planner.\n\n    \"The huge air-conditioning systems currently used to \ncool buildings get rid of the heat they take out of the \nstructure by venting it into the outside air, raising \ntemperatures still further and creating a 'heat island' \nphenomenon in large cities.  (((Soon whole *cities* will \ndo it and vent their heat straight into the rising seas! \nLook out, Antarctica.)))\n\n    \"Under the plan, this heat would be transferred to \nwater in large underground tanks, and the water then \npumped through a six-km (3.7-mile) network of underground \npipes to a cooling plant on the Tokyo waterfront.\n\n    \"There the heat from this water would be transferred \nto cooler sea water before the then-cooled water was \npumped back through the underground pipes. The sea water, \nnow warmed, would be released into the waters of Tokyo \nBay.\n\n    \"COSTLY PLAN.  (((That's unsurprising.)))  Minobe said \nthe plan would cover some 123 hectares (304 acres) in the \ncentre of Tokyo, including the Marunouchi business \ndistrict and the posh Ginza shopping area, and would \ninitially cost around 41 billion yen ($344 million).\n\n    \"'Savings on reduced energy usage would eventually \nhelp pay for this,' he said.  (((A real nest of ironies \nhere, folks.))) Officials quoted in the English-language \nJapan Times said energy savings would total more than 1 \nbillion yen a year, meaning the system would pay for \nitself in a bit over 30 years.\n\n    \"However, Minobe said many problems remained with the \nplan, which has only been under discussion since April \nlast year. One of the most serious problems is whether \nwarmer water being returned to Tokyo Bay would damage the \nfragile marine ecosystem, a point Minobe said still \nrequired more study.  (((Give it 30 years and there won't \nbe any ecosystem left to study.)))\n\n    \"He said the average temperature cut is likely to be \nonly around 0.4 degrees. 'I'm not even sure people would \nbe able to feel that difference,' he said. Any such plan, \nhowever, would likely produce a gleam in the eyes of \nJapan's huge construction industry, known for its \npropensity for public works projects. Although several are \ndecried as wasteful, public works projects have long been \nused by the government in attempts to stimulate the \neconomy.  (((Nice use of the word \"attempts.\")))\n\n    \"Frankly, I think this plan is still really more of a \ndream than anything else,\" Minobe said. \n\nO=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O\nTOKYO STAYS COOL\nAS DEADLY HEATWAVE BAKES \nKOBE, OSAKA, KYOTO\nO=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O\n\n\n"}
