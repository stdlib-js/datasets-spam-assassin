I did an \nNFS install of a box this morning (that would be the box which won't boot \nfrom CD for those who were in IRC) and it was rather slow but I just left it \nto it. Having got it up, I want to copy the DVD to a disk on it so I have it \nhandy for installing any further bits I might require. So I simply mounted \nthe NFS exported DVD on the new box and started copying. \n\nAfter a couple of minutes I looked - it was transferring about 8MB a MINUTE. \nSo I killed that and used rsync instead which is ticking away now at about \n100 MB/min - still not exactly turbo charged but a lot better than the NFS \nrate. Any ideas as to what's making it SO slow ? There's really no point in \nrunning more nfsd processes, as there is exactly one client, so I'm a little \nat a loss I must say.\n\n\n\nNiall\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
