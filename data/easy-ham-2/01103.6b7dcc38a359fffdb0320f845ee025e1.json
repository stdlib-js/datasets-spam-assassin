OK.\n \nThese results don't help break EC crypto at all.\n \nWith RSA, you pick a number with secret factors and to break the\ncryptosystem, you can factor the number.  Due to fast sub-exponential\nalgorithms for factoring, the number had better be 1024 bits at the\nvery least (record = 524 bits).\n \nWith EC, you pick a curve and pick points on the curve with secret\ndiscrete logarithm.  To break the cryptosystem you can compute a\ndiscrete log but the best algorithms for random curves are exponential\n(record = 109 bits, for a slightly special curve).\n \nUp until now, people pick curves chosen from a small fixed set.  One\nchoice is a few curves with special properties that originally were\nchosen to make point-counting easier, and can also speed up the crypto\noperations, but in some cases they can also speed up attacks, not on\ncurves deployed at the moment but the danger exists.  The other\nchoice is to precompute a handful of random curves.  The NSA did this\na few years ago when it took hours on a fast machine and NIST\nstandardized those curves.\n \nWhat changes is that it is now possible is to generate your own curves\non an ordinary PC.  This has been getting easier and easier, with\nsmall curves taking seconds on a fast machine since a year or two.\nNow even reasonably big curves take seconds on a typical PC.\n \nThis means that you don't have to rely on standard curves but can\ndistribute risk over many curves in case some get broken at some\nstage.  In certain circumstances you can even keep the curve itself\nsecret so an attacker doesn't know which discrete log to try to\ncompute!  There isn't really a good analogy with RSA, but imagine\nwanting to factor a number and you don't even know what it is...\n \nSo basically recent progress has made new things feasible and this\nmakes them even more so.  The underlying primitives for signing,\nencoding and so on are not affected, but the security vibes get better.\n \nR\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
