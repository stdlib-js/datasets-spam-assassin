Then you could specify a minimum value of\n*that* parameter to flatten at, giving assurances that you're killing\nonly tests that are expensive for their utility.\n\nUnfortunately I can't think of a good name for that parameter.\n\nI can whip up a patch if anyone thinks this is any use.\n\n-- \n`There's something satisfying about killing JWZ over and over again.'\n                                        -- 1i, personal communication\n\n\n"}
