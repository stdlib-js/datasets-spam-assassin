It's gonna be a gateway for\na wireless network and will sit in my room (as my room is only\nspitting distance from the chimney where i'll be mounting the aerial) \nIt has to be completely silent, or it'll do my nut. What do I need? \n\nI'll prob use a shitty p166 i have here, it doesnt have a fan, and I'm not\nworried about HD noise too much as it'll be idle mostly (should I be?) \nany info would be appreciated. I can't afford one of those lovely new\nshoebox size totally silent pcs and I cant use an old laptop as I have a\npci wireless card and cable already bought (160$ or so)\n\nAnd where can I get a fanless psu? I know they exist because the lads\nat antefacto had them (lads, where can I get one?). Although I do remember\na slight lack of metal box around the humongous voltage parts!\n\tGreg\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group Social Events: social@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/social for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
