Razor isn't your mail \nserver. It doesn't keep in your mail. You don't request your mail there. \nNor do most people check for spam only when they are going to read their \nmail. My setup check a mail against Razor when my server receives it, \nnot when I'm going to read it. If you wait to get 1000 reply for a mail, \nit means you have to wait for 1000 people to read it (at least, some \npeople may not vote because they don't want to vote that day or because \nthey don't think it's spam). Knowing that about half the planet would be \nsleeping (night time) and thus not reading their mail, it would mean \nthat at least 2000 people already received the mail in their inbox. \nKnowing that, among the people who are not sleeping, not all of them are \nconstantly reading their mail. I would say that less than 1 people over \n10 read their mail as soon as it arrives. That means that 20,000 people \nalready recieved the mail and checked it against the Razor database \nbefore you would get your 1000 votes.\n\nAlso, with your system, 99% is the best you could get. If you wait for \nonly one vote, maybe only 20 guy would read the mail (1 to vote, 10 \nsleeping, and 9 not reading their mail soon enough). Wich gives a value \n99.98%. That's far better than your 99% don't you think.\nIn RealLife(tm), most likely one guy voting won't be enough but the \nthing is that it will stop the spam as early as possible.\n\nAlso, if for some reason, this mail is one of those people don't agree \non whether it is spam or not, it would take a while to revoke those 1000 \nreports, which means that some people may lose this legitimate (to them) \nmail.\n\nYou mentioned that with this system, people will re-report less often. \nFirst, I don't see how waiting *longer* before making a decision on the \nlegitimacy of a mail will reduce re-reporting. The more you wait, the \nmore people will get the mail in their inbox, the more people will see \nthe mail (again, not everybody check their mail against Razor at read \ntime, most do it a reception time using procmail/spamassassin). Second, \nre-reporting has its use, it increase the confidence that a mail is spam.\n\nSo I don't see what you gain with your 1000 people.\n\n\tJehan\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board\nfor high-tech professionals.
