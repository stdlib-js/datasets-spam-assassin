I'm aware that maybe more publicity surrounding\nsome and certain agencies have been granted more funding, but \nI'd like to see some data which shows if these are increasing\nor not. \n\nWhy? Well, it seems to me if we were going to get hit, the one\nthat does it may have been part of a larger swarm or cluster\nwhich has over the years increased the distance between the\nrocks. Like the Schumaker Levy-9, which had multiple rocks\nall impacting at different times, others may have this same\ntype of design and could be in different stages of increasing\ndistance from one another. Also to consider is if SL-9 was\non course for earth, would we get hit by all rocks or only\none because the earth is a much smaller target than Jupiter?\n\nSo, my theory is that if these near earth rocks are increasing\nso does our chance of discovering the last three were part of\na swarm of 15 of which 10, 11 and 12 may hit.\n\n\n\nOn 24-Jul-2002, bitbitch@magnesium.net wrote:\n> >\n> > Hit or miss, Groundhog Day 2019 is going to be one heck of a show.
