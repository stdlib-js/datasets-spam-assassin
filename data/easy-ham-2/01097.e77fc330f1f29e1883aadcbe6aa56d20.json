If you can't find someone willing to\npay your costs of development then most likely there really isn't a need\nfor the product you're trying to sell and you shouldn't develop it. If you\nhave to resort to free versions with lame ass ads and stuff then that is a\nstrong indication to get a new project IMO.  :)\n\n\n> We were sitting here talking about Opera, and the fact that it's not\n> free anymore (unless you want the scrollypollies), and how that sucked\n> and stuff, and someone said something about nagware, and I\n> misinterpretted it as snag ware, which mainly means, oh yeh, right, I'm\n> gonna buy this -eyeroll- where's someone with a key?
