I've made a lot of friends in the\nMS complaints department, its amazing what you can say to them and get away\nwith it --::)))\n\nCW\n\nAnd no sorry I don't know the solution, they must be pretty bad quality\nthough if you can fit 25 albums on one CD. I would say they are Mpeg encoded\nor some buzz like that. \n\n---------------------\nI've got some really interesting wav files here.\n\nA friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .\n\nEvery Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and \nBBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!\n\nOf course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this\ncollection!\n\nI had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don't do Windows, and the \nalbums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it's own wav file, 25 \nAlbums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. \n\nCurious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to \nattempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it\ndoesn't \ncrash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them \ncompletely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!\n\nxanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does not\n\nhave any position control so you just have to listen to the album from start\n\nto finish.\n\nfile has this to say about them:\n\njohngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV\nbeatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM, \nstereo 22050 Hz\njohngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV\n-r-xr-xr-x    1 johngay  johngay  53334900 Sep 27  2001 beatles/SGT.WAV\n\nAnd this is SGT Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good, \nconsidering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in\nstereo.\n\nWhat I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for \nxmms. I'm jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange \ncompressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but \nwould prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums \nand be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV \nplugin, but it does not recognise these either.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated!\n\nCheers,\n\n\tJohn Gay\n\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
