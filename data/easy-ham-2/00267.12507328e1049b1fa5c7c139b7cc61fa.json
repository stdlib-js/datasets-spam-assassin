It turns out that it was an IRQ conflict with an old \nsound card.\n\nDespite checking the BIOS and running the 3c509 setup utility on \nhttp://www.scyld.com/diag, the 2.4 kernel still picked a card on IRQ 5 and 10.\n\nIt works fine now that the sound card is removed, but I'm still confused as to \nwhy this worked in 2.2.18 but not 2.4.19, seems like a regression to me...\n\nThanks again,\n\nCheers,\n~Al\n\nOriginal question:\n> Hi folks,\n> \n> I decided to upgrade the kernel on a machine at home from 2.2.18pre21 to the latest from kernel.org which is 2.4.19.\n> \n> However I have encountered one problem, my network card now dosent work, well kind of dosent work...\n> \n> Instead of one eth0 on IRQ 10 I now get:\n> Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: eth0: 3c5x9 at 0x220, 10baseT port, address  00 10 5a 3e 0e 48, IRQ 5.\n> Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: 3c509.c:1.18 12Mar2001 becker@scyld.com\n> Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: http://www.scyld.com/network/3c509.html\n> Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: eth1: 3c5x9 at 0x300, 10baseT port, address  00 10 5a be 0e 48, IRQ 10.\n> Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: 3c509.c:1.18 12Mar2001 becker@scyld.com\n> Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: http://www.scyld.com/network/3c509.html\n> \n> This results in the interface(s) coming up but while packets can go out they can not come in.\n> \n> I've tried not loading the 3c509 mdule on bootup and then `modload 3c509 IRQ=10` bit it still gets loaded as above, on IRQ 5 and 10. On 2.2 it loads to IRQ 10.\n> \n> Anyone got any suggestions on what to do here? Its a debian 3.0 distro. This works fine when booted to 2.2 so the hardware/BIOS etc seem ok, so it seems to be 2.4 spacific. Have I missed some kernel setting?\n> \n> Cheers,\n> ~Al\n\n-- \nExpressed in this posting are my opinions.
