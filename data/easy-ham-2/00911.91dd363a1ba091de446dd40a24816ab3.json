Too much freedom, too many ways that\nthe INdividual is called on to be thier own guardian...too many demands on\nthe fraility of human nature...much better to errect protectors, let them\nsort it all out, and tell us what we need to do to be happy.\n\n\nSmart in todays society is having enough Welath, Charm, Will, Power,\nKnowing etc to Do What You Want.\n\nStupid is living under others rules.\n\n\n(to the stupid the smart are \"stupid\" \"look at them, wasting all thier\ntime  on that tomfollery\" \"lords a goshen, aint they the queer ones\"\n\"would you  look at that, some folks just dont have the sense to fit in\")\n\n\nThe words Smart and Atupid are the wrong ones here...
