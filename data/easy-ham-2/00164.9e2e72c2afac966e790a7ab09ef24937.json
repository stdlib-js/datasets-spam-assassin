If the drives are open-the-box-and-switch-cables, then you can\nstart dd'ing a floppy before you start.  If the drives are in drawers, then this\nmight slow you down by all of 60 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, you could use netboot.  No, I'm serious.  Set the boot sequence\nto first hard disk then network.  Do NOT make any partition on the standby\nactive.  Have a look at the etherboot package.  One of the things it contains is\na pascal-ish language for writing boot menus.  You can write a one-liner that\nbasically says \"boot /dev/hda1\" (or whatever, there's example code).  IIRC, the\nresulting \"bootable image\" is a whopping 4K.  The downside is you'll need a\nbootp and tftp server somewhere....\n\nhth,\nRonan.\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
