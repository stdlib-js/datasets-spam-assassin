There's nothing you can\ndo just before the impact with a system that was designed to deal with\ntiny ballistic missiles, and largely by damaging them, not destroying\nthem. Apart from twiddling with the surface albedo which might be not\nenough -- we currently don't have ion drives with enough power, or at\nleast we can't develop and deploy them on time, so that only leaves you\nwith nukes. Assymetrical repeated flash-evaporation (anything closer would\nrisk fragmenting it) on rocks of unknown composition (could be a pile of\nrubble for all what we know) has never been tried yet, though.\n\n> I'm not holding my breath, but i'm not going to panic for something thats\n> a little under 17 years away, either.\n\nIt is much more interesting whether you can kill enough of delta v for a \ncapture. But here trying to brake a smaller object (say, few 100 m across) \nwith final stage aerobraking would be far more useful. Otoh, one could as \nwell could invest that effort into a launch capacity on the Moon.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
