Looney\" <valen@tuatha.org>\n  |[ ... ]\n  | That's something that POSIX would do - make every platform as\n  | equally broken, rather than standing up and saying \"how about\n  | we try & make everyone better\".\n\n eh?  POSIX doesn't \"do\" anything.  POSIX is a de jour\n specification for a voluntary minimal implementation to\n encourage software transportability.  no-one, absolutely\n no-one, has or ever had to implement POSIX or be restricted\n to POSIX.  commercial considerations et.al. may encourage\n some \"POSIX-compatibility\", but that's a freely-made choice.\n\n IMHO, the process's weakness is a general rule --- which\n has been ignored on occasion --- to only consider \"formal\"\n submissions of \"proven\" technologies.  that translates into\n specifying more-or-less common parts of the existing *ix\n implementations which actively contribute to the process.\n most of the committees are loath to blue-sky, solicit\n proposals/research, or pick an uncommon or unsponsored\n implementation, even when manifestly superior.  (IMHO,\n this is why POSIX is *ix and not, e.g., Plan9 or Inferno.)\n\n OTOH, considering the motivating force behind the process,\n it can be argued the above \"weakness\" is a strength ....\n\n  | (why? Because in the real world, you can't. Somethings just suck)\n\n yep.  which is not to say POSIX \"sucks\" per se.  but the old\n pre-POSIX *ix world arguably did, at least in terms of ease\n of software porting.  one of *ix's claims to fame is it is\n perhaps the first system where one could seriously consider\n porting, more or less intact and with relative ease, software\n from one architecture+platform+vendor to a radically utterly\n different triple.\n\n however, as people discovered, there's a lot of difference\n between \"consider porting\" and \"actually porting\" --- and\n some problems were silly.  some were self-inflicted (e.g.,\n assuming byte-orientation or a particular endianness); but\n others were Frustrating \"system\" incompatibilities --- the\n motivating force that lead to /usr/group, XPG (X/Open), POSIX,\n Spec1170, Unix98, Common Unix, &tc.\n\n     «The nice thing about standards is there's so many to\n      choose from.»   -- commonly attributed to bwk.\n\ncheers!\n\t-blf-\n--\n Innovative, very experienced, Unix and      | Brian Foster    Dublin, Ireland\n Chorus (embedded RTOS) kernel internals     | e-mail: blf@utvinternet.ie\n expert looking for a new position ...       | mobile: (+353 or 0)86 854 9268\n  For a résumé, contact me, or see my website  http://www.blf.utvinternet.ie\n\n    Stop E$$o (ExxonMobile):  «Whatever you do, don't buy Esso --- they\n     don't give a damn about global warming.»    http://www.stopesso.com\n     Supported by Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and numerous others...\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
