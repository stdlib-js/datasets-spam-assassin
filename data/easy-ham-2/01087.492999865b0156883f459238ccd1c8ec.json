Value is not always necessarily defined by quality \n(just look at 802.11).\n\nIf I had a self-contained communications unit that let me share \nthings: documents, the weather, my new hairdo, by newborn baby, \netc. and it fit in my pocket then it might encourage me to share \nthose things more often.  If we're talking on the phone and you ask \nme what the weather is like and I say \"hang on\", outstretch the \ndevice with my arm extended, press a button, and instantly send you \na picture on me with blue sky in the background, that has value.\n\nBut if I say \"hang on\", fumble around in my briefcase for a digital \ncamera, and  after 5 minutes of plugging and praying with USB \nfinally am able to take a photo of me, bound by several feet of \ncable and multiple devices, well, that doesn't really have value.\n\nIf I'm a Paparazzi I'd love to be able to send high-res photos \nusing my mobile phone because that has real economic impact, and I \ncould put up with the hassle for the amount of time it saves me.  \nHowever, I don't think that is the market that Sprint PCS is \ncontemplating.\n\nThe fact that Sprint has not made the assumption that both the \nsender and recipient of the picture are using their mobile phones \nwill help this survive. Gets around the whole \"fax\" problem (where \nboth sender and receiver have to have faxes in order for that \ntechnology to be useful).\n\nOn the whole, not very useful for regular Joes (pun intended).  Put \nthe camera in the phone (even a low-res one) and then it'd at least \nbe cool.\n\n-Ian.\n\nOn Monday, August 19, 2002, at 05:04 AM, Joseph S.
