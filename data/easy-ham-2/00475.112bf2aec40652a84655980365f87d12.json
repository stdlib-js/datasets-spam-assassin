Linux\ncan be configured to do either this, or to have the RTC at UTC,\nand then use /etc/localtime to figure out the right timezone.\n\nDepending on how you've set it up, this may be a problem (with one\nor other of the OS's one hour out). OS-X also does this silliness :(\n\n(RTC should always have UTC, that way different people can set their\nown timezone on the machine... though I suppose that only applies\nto multi-user machines).\n\nL.\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
