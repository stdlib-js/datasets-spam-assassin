OK, now fixed; I've updated b2_4_0 to match what I wanted,\naccordingly.  As a result, mass-checks do *NOT* need to be restarted as\nthe code and rules are the same as they were on HEAD.\n\ncvs tag spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b\n\nSo, in full, here's the changes that are in spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b that\nwere not there before the branch:\n\n  - rules fixed: HTTP_ESCAPED_HOST, HTTP_CTRL_CHARS_HOST.  they were too\n    lax and caused FPs\n\n  - Matt's faster HTML parser\n\n  - commented rules un-commented again\n\n  - a doco fix for spamd\n\n\nand, for completeness, the relevant changes since Saturday:\n\n  - the INSTALL file ;)\n\n  - CALL_NOW now starts on a word boundary\n\n  - Added examples to -R docs\n  \n  - Added Habeas HIL lookup\n\n  - bug 385: spamcheck.py should handle 4xx errors -- full mailboxes etc.\n    -- with EX_TEMPFAIL. patch from ckd-spamassassin@ckdhr.com\n    (Christopher Davis) applied.\n\n  -  made spamcheck.py use exit code 75 if it cannot connect to spamd,\n     fixes bug 655\n\n  - spamd/spamd.raw: fixed bug 704: spamd was not able to unlink pid file\n    with -u arg\n\n  - Makefile.PL: installing to random dirs now works fine\n\n  - move MAILER_DAEMON into 70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf since it has been\n    improved remove extraneous mass-check line for DATE_YEAR_ZERO_FIRST\n\n  - spamassassin.raw: merged -Z with -D\n\n  - removed eff.org from whitelists, as per Marc's request\n\n  - mass-check: added versioning and date to mass-check output\n\n  - bug 658: ok_locales set to 'en' by default. changed to 'all', users\n    will have to customise for themselves.   Made many tests which trigger\n    FPs on mail in ISO-2022-JP charsets, meta rules depending on\n    __ISO_2022_JP_DELIM.\n\n  - fixed phrase-freq code for vastly better performance\n\n  - rules/50_scores.cf: changed LISTBUILDER score back to -5.0\n\n  - lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm: catch background images in uri code\n    catch additional types of web bugs\n\n  - rules/20_body_tests.cf: change CASHCASHCASH to meta rule to avoid\n    Japanese false matches, revise spam phrases descriptions to be clearer\n    (since a few are now basically compensation tests (please don't move\n    them to the compensation file))\n\n  - fixed bug in MIME_SUSPECT_NAME: text/plan attachments called foo.html\n    were triggering.\n\n  - revise HTML comment tests to use HTML parser\n\n  - revise MAILER_DAEMON rule (get rid of some spam matches without losing\n    any nonspam matches)\n\n  - raise some negative scores that are way too low\n\n  - remove \"Friend\" from DEAR_SOMETHING since it overlaps with DEAR_FRIEND\n    and can match \"dear friend\" in middle of sentence too much\n\n  - require \"Dear Friend\" to start the paragraph\n\n  - add new HTML tests for font colors and faces, reduce number of\n    different eval functions needed for HTML tests\n\n--j.\n\n-- \n'Justin Mason' => { url => http://jmason.org/ , blog => http://taint.org/ }\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?
