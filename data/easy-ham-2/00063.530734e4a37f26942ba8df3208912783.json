It's written in PHP and bash shell script, uses RRDtool  for stats \nlogging, and PostgreSQL for the server-side database.

I had a bit of a \nproblem getting it to work on rh6.2 boxes but I documented the changes here: \nhttp://xeer.blogspot.com/?/2002_07_01_xeer_archive.html#79148596\n\nWeb interface is simple, but functional. It has a simple way of distributing \nthe monitoring scripts (which could be compromised but I digress), and the \nresulting graphs are pretty!\n\nDonncha.\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
