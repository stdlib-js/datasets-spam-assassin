The sensors have got to be tens\nor even hundreds of times more accurate/robust \nthan when barcodes first took off.\n\nOne segment of the article along these lines:\n\n> But moving to 13 digits may not be enough. The Universal\n> Code Council and EAN International, which formed an\n> alliance in 1996, strongly advise manufacturers and\n> retailers to go a step further and prepare their systems to\n> accommodate a 14-digit code. That is the length of a newly\n> patented bar code that takes up less space. Its reduced\n> size means that it can be affixed to small items like loose\n> produce, and the extra digits let a retailer keep track of\n> additional data like batch and lot numbers. \n\nA newly *patented* bar code, that merely fits 14 digits\ninto less space? I sure hope there's more to this\n\"invention\" than \"more lines, and narrower\". \n\nThey might as well go 2-D to fit in lots of extra bits,\nwhich could also ease the transition to the capacity \nradio-transponder tags may offer.\n\nA bunch of info on different barcode standards, including\n2-D variants, with examples is at:\n\nhttp://www.makebarcode.com/specs/speclist.html\n\nSomething very much like a 2-D barcode is Xerox \"Dataglyphs\":\n\nhttp://www.parc.com/solutions/dataglyphs/\n\n- Gordon\n____________________   \nGordon Mohr <gojomo@ . . .
