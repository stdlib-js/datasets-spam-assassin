It is easier to sit on knowledge than to\ncontinually acquire more on the frontiers.\n\n> This should actually be easy to test experimentally: compare the results\n> of having someone call up and say, \"Can you show us how to do X for this\n> project we're working on?\" with those of having someone summoned by a\n> knowledge management project to explain how to do X for the knowledge\n> archives.\n\nThis is in fact very true.  People hate doing this for several reasons in\nmy experience:\n1) \"Software changes.   Why waste time writing a FAQ now that will be out\nof date at the next release in 3 months?\"\n2) \"This knowledge is specialized.  Only 4 people need to know this, and\nthey already do.  If anyone else needs to know it they know who they can\ncall.\"\nThe same engineers who give these excuses will spend eternities on the\nphone discussing this arcana and sharing the knowledge with anyone who has\nthe patience to ask.\n\nThe strongest contributors freely share everything they know whenever\nasked (or whenever they see the need for the information in the company)\nand who at the same time continue to generate new knowledge.\n\nPersonal evaluation: my worth comes slightly lower on the scale in that I\nsynthesize the knowledge from various personal sharing exercises into\nusable documents and messages for the company to employ.  This would seem\nlike a marketing exercise except that Marketing is useless.   Useful\nknowledge sharing comes (IMHO) from engineering and sales.\n\n\tJTS\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
