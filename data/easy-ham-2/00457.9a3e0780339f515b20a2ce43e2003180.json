This\nwill only happen twice a year. How to stop it, I have not checked (I\njust switch the clock back an hour from within windows after such a\nreboot).  Is there a GMT windows timezone?\n\nWith ntp, it is a big no-no (afaik) to have other programs messing with\nthe clock as it will put ntp's calculations of drift etc., out. (maybe\nthis only applies to chrony, which is what I use).  If the windows\nchange only moves forward an hour, and you shift back an hour, maybe ntp\nwill be (relatively) ok (depends if all the remaining digits of time\nprecision are left unchanged, probably they aren't exactly).\nm\n-- \nMichael Conry   Ph.:+353-1-7161987, Web: http://www.acronymchile.com\nKey fingerprint = 5508 B563 6791 5C84 A947  CB01 997B 3598 09DE 502C\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"}
