I'll tone down\nthe rhetoric.\n\nQuoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):\n\n> Indeed - that I actually had understood prior to all this - for\n> example commercial entities with trial/limited/crippled editions. \n> \n> Which is no problem - I don't see why that should be a problem for\n> SuSE though - surely the more the merrrier as far as they're\n> concerned.\n\nAnything either you or I have to say about their motivation is\nspeculation.  Bearing that disclaimer in mind, here's mine:  They make\nmoney from selling boxed sets.  They're glad to make some versions\navailable for almost-unrestricted distribution (not \"for value\") via CD\nduplication or the Internet that they estimate won't substitute for\nboxed-set sales.\n\nFor example, they _could_ have packaged what I call the \"FTP edition\" \nin ISO9660 images.  The fact that they didn't suggests to me that they\nsee the inconvenience of mirroring FTP Edition i386 files (which, at the\nmoment, are v. 8.0) as motivation for all but the really determined to\nbuy boxed sets, instead.  \n\nLikewise, they _could_ release a v. 8.0 (current) version of the\n\"evaluation\" single-disk ISO image.  Instead, they always keep it\nseveral versions behind.  This again seems like an incentive to buy a\nboxed set, after \"evaluating\" SuSE via the ISO image.\n\nAgain, the above is my speculation (only) about their motivations.  All\nwe know of a certainty is what permissions they've granted, which are a\nbit messy and complex, but nonetheless quite clear.\n\nThose permissions, as a reminder, apply to the SuSE-produced components,\nYaST, YaST2, the distribution installer program, and possibly other\nutilities that I don't know of.  _They_ wrote that code, and have every\nright to grant or withhold permissions as suit them best.\n\n> One can suspect what one likes. What I didn't understand was that SuSE\n> had proprietary extensions that it wasn't prepared to allow people to\n> use under the GPL or even under  a FreeBSD style licence.\n\nHmm, let's slow down, here:  There's a persistent misconception that\nit's possible to place somebody else's work under a new licence without\nhis permission.  Not so.  There is nothing in copyright law that would\nmake that possible.\n\nThe copyright _owner_ has inherent rights in his (e.g., software) work,\nand is entitled to issue as many _instances_ of his code under diverse\nlicences as he wishes.  (If he gives you a copy with no licence\nstatement, there's effectively a default licence by operation of\ncopyright law.  To avoid going into a long digression, let me just say\nthat it's a proprietary licence by default.  That's why, in order to\nhave open source software at all, there must be an explicit licence\nfrom the copyright holder.)\n\nNo Linux distribution _ever_ entails relicensing people's software\nwithout their explicit permission -- since no such relicensing can occur\nat all. \n \nYou cannot get away with taking SuSE Linux AG's work and redistributing\nit under what you claim to be a BSD licence, or the GPL, or anything at\nall other than what the copyright owner has specified, because you\nsimply lack the right to do so.  Claiming to do it would be copyright\nviolation.\n\n> I thought that the model for the likes of SuSE was selling support and\n> customisation, rather than what I thought of as the core \"product\".

They did not.  They didn't even require that anybody give\nyou copies of the GPLed components, ever, at all.  All they did was\nrequire that _if_ you received GPLed software lawfully, then you had to \nbe able to get matching source code for a limited period, upon request.\n\nSpirit of the GPL, you say?  I'd suggest that Stallman and company knew\nexactly what they were doing, and that the degree of access to GPLed\nsoftware is exactly what they had in mind.\n \n> All I want is the OS and GNU apps. I was under the impression that for\n> *_those_* all one needed was to pay for the media and not for the code\n> itself?\n> \n> Ai-je tort?\n\nMais si.\n\nYou are indeed under a misconception, and may want to read the text of\nthe GPL to verify this fact.  The GPL does _not_ entitle you to a copy\nof any binary software.  Section 2 provides for rights to access to\nmatching source code _if_ you have lawfully received a copy of a covered\nbinary.  That section provides three alternative mechanisms for the\ndistributor to provide such access.  And SuSE _do_ actually provide \nexactly that access.\n\nOr so I think to be the case.  If you believe there's some GPLed\ncodebase that you can lawfully receive from SuSE whose matching source\ncode they are not making available exactly as required, please tell us\nwhich codebase that is.  (That would be SuSE Linux AG's headache, not\nany of ours, but it might be interesting to examine.)\n\n> My understanding was that binaries or whatever could be received for\n> the cost of the media plus a token of one's appreciation (the latter\n> being subject to agreement between the parties) - I was offering a\n> bottle of wine plus maybe a pint or two and a chat for a copy - I\n> don't know what the going rate is.\n\nYour understanding is almost correct, but not quite.  (1) The access\nprovisions of the GPL concern access to _source code_, not binaries.\n(2) It kicks in _only_ for people who've lawfully received covered\nbinaries.  (3) _Covered_ software means instances of codebases actually\nplaced under the GNU GPL by their copyright owners.  The mere act of \nplacing a piece of software on a CD-ROM with GPLed software doesn't GPL\nit.\n\nIn fact, the assertion to the contrary is a favourite FUD tactic from\nenemies of Linux:  They're forever trying to convince software producers\nthat using GPLed software in any way with their proprietary offerings\nwill \"taint\" their copyrights and force them to put their property under\nthe GPL.  It's simply not so.\n\n> If I wanted support from SuSE, that would be a different issue, and\n> one for which I would be willing to pay.\n\nThat's nice, but they're not _offering_ the exact contents of the boxed\nsets free of charge and lawful to duplicate & redistribute, or \"borrow\".\nFor one thing, as you will have noticed from my earlier listing of\ncomponents, the boxed sets' CD-ROMs include quite a lot of _third-party_\nproprietary software.  SuSE Linux AG _cannot_ allow you (or your friend)\nto hand out copies of that software freely, because it's not theirs in\nthe first place.\n \n> I have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll end up doing that!\n\nIf you mean the 3-CD core set of RH 7.3, good.  It's a quite decent\ndistribution.  But bear in mind that the RH 7.3 boxed sets include\nsome other third-party applications whose owners would be very upset to\nfind them being copied or \"borrowed\". \n\n> I have now realised this, thanks to your kind explanations. I can\n> borrow them, but not copy them? \n\nNo.\n\nLook, it's a collection of software, many elements of which may not be\nlawfully just given out to multiple people:  Your friend installing it,\nthen _not_ erasing it but merely letting you \"borrow\" the CDs results in\nthe product being installed in multiple places.  That's unauthorised\ncopying.\n\n> And, as I've tried to explain, is not the licence terms on, say,\n> trials for commercial company x to which I object, it is the way SuSE\n> appears, at least to my I.T. peasant self, to have mixed up\n> proprietary and open stuff.\n\nWell, if you don't like SuSE, then you probably won't like Caldera\neDesk, Xandros Desktop, Lycoris Deskop LX, Libranet, Lindows, or KRUD,\neither.  Depending on your criteria, you also might not like Red Hat,\nLinux-Mandrake, or Yellow Dog, since all of those have boxed-set retail\nsets that include CD-ROMs that may not be publicly redistributed.\n \n(I don't even use SuSE.  I'm just trying to clarify the licensing\nquestion.)\n\n-- \nCheers,                                             Live Faust, die Jung.\nRick Moen\nrick@linuxmafia.com\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
