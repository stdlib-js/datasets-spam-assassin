The lawsuits prevented the Forest Service \nfrom implementation of any project that involved tree removal.  These \nprojects were designed to address the tree and undergrowth density that \nresulted from previous management policies.\n\nIn other words, Forest Service projects to clean up the mess resulting from \ntheir previous forest management practices are prevented by tree lover \nlawsuits.\n\n > 40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of \nstuff\n > left to burn.\n\nExactly, and tree lover lawsuits are preventing the removal of that \nstuff.  The result:  Fires like Cerro Grande.\n\n > I can't imagine that artificially planted replacement\n > forests ...\n\nThere are very few replacement forests planted these days.  Those that are, \nare mostly planted on private land as commercial tree farms.\n\nPeace,\n\nMarty Halvorson\nmarty@halvorson.us\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
