Right.\n\n Antefacto Embedded Linux...did.\n\n Nice little distro that'd run on a 64MB flash card (with 12MB free), with\na read-only root filesystem. Perfect for little embedded systems. It was a\nvery cut down version of RedHat 7.2.\n\n Must see can we release the build system & everything. That was the\ninteresting bit. Distros, in general, are a waste of time. You've no idea\nhow much better something like Debian or RedHat could be than something\nyou did yourself, unless you picked a niche area.\n\nKate\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
