This kernel update also fixes a difficult to trigger race in\nthe dcache (filesystem cache) code, as well as some potential security\nholes, although we are not currently aware of any exploits.\n\nDescription:\nThe 2.4.18-5 kernel introduced some safety checks in the VM subsystem that\nwere triggered when exiting an X session while using 3D acceleration with\nthe Intel i810/i815 chipset. Additionally, there was a difficult to trigger\nrace in the dcache of the file system subsystem.\n\nThis kernel update addresses both of these issues.\n\nIn addition, there are fixes for potential security holes in the following\ndrivers:\n\nstradis\nrio500\nse401\nusbvideo\napm\n\nFinally, this kernel fixes a few files in the /proc file system which had\nthe capability to expose kernel memory when abused.\n\nAll of the security issues found during an audit and none of them,  at the\ntime of this writing, have any known exploits.\n\nWe would like to thank Silvio Cesare, Stas Sergeev, Andi Kleen, Solar\nDesigner, and others for their auditing work.\n\nReferences:\nhttp://www.thefreeworld.net/non-US/\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------\nTaking Action\n-------------\nYou may address the issues outlined in this advisory in two ways:\n\n     - select your server name by clicking on its name from the list\n       available at the following location, and then schedule an\n       errata update for it:\n           https://rhn.redhat.com/network/systemlist/system_list.pxt\n\n     - run the Update Agent on each affected server.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nChanging Notification Preferences\n---------------------------------\nTo enable/disable your Errata Alert preferences globally please log in to RHN\nand navigate from \"Your RHN\" / \"Your Account\" to the \"Preferences\" tab.\n\n        URL: https://rhn.spamassassin.taint.org/network/my_account/my_prefs.pxt\n\nYou can also enable/disable notification on a per system basis by selecting an\nindividual system from the \"Systems List\".

If you know that\nthis errata does not apply to a system listed, it might be possible that the\npackage profile for that server is out of date.
