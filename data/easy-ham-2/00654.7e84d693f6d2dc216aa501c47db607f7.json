It's\ncompletely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to\nsee. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for\nthemselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.\n\nContrast this with TeS which utilizes \"sooper secret\" methodologies to\ndetermine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point\nsomething becomes spam at some level of \"confidence.\"\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly\nineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about\na 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don't count as spam,\napparently because I'm not trusted enough, or enough people haven't submitted\nthe item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to\nwaste their time submitting items when they aren't being accepted due to\na series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.\n\nAny trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn't worth trusting IMHO.\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\\n                               Patrick Greenwell\n         Asking the wrong questions is the leading cause of wrong answers\n\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?
