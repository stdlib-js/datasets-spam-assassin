Unlike, for\nexample, India or Asia.\n\nThere is a hot dispute about the original size of the indigenous\npopulation, but the evidence for a high density in the Mexican area is\nsound.  It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I'm a little\nmore suspicious of very high upward revisions.\n\nAt least that was my take.\n\nI have never heard anyone seriously argue that European diseases were\nnot a significant factor, or that there were not in fact a lot of Aztec\npeople prior to Cortez.  Gee, I've never before heard someone argue\nunseriously about it either.\n\nDo you have a reference for a book or article which does so?\n\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nRobert\n> Harley\n> Sent: Sunday, August 18, 2002 4:57 PM\n> To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org\n> Cc: rah@shipwright.com\n> Subject: Re: Al'Qaeda's fantasy ideology: Policy Review no. 114\n> \n> >See Jared Diamond's excellent \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" for the story.\n> \n> Yeah, I know the party line.
