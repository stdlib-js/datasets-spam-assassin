Earlier this year, the RIAA announced its new \nplan to access computers without owner's consent for the sake of \nprotecting its assets. Information Wave believes this policy puts its \ncustomers at risk of unintentional damage, corporate espionage, and \ninvasion of privacy to say the least.\n\nDue to the nature of this matter and RIAA's previous history, we feel \nthe RIAA will abuse software vulnerabilities in a client's browser after \nthe browser accesses its site, potentially allowing the RIAA to access \nand/or tamper with your data. Starting at midnight on August 19, 2002, \nInformation Wave customers will no longer be able to reach the RIAA's \nweb site. Information Wave will also actively seek out attempts by the \nRIAA to thwart this policy and apply additional filters to protect our \ncustomers' data.\n\nInformation Wave will also deploy peer-to-peer clients on the Gnutella \nnetwork from its security research and development network (honeynet) \nwhich will offer files with popular song titles derived from the \nBillboard Top 100 maintained by VNU eMedia. No copyright violations will \ntake place, these files will merely have arbitrary sizes similar to the \nlength of a 3 to 4 minute MP3 audio file encoded at 128kbps. Clients \nwhich connect to our peer-to-peer clients, and then afterwards attempt \nto illegally access the network will be immediately blacklisted from \nInformation Wave's network. The data collected will be actively \nmaintained and distributed from our network operations site.\n\nThe placement of this policy is not intended to hamper the RIAA's piracy \nelimination agenda or advocate Internet piracy, but to ensure the safety \nof our customers' data attached to our network from hackers or corporate \nespionage hidden by the veil of RIAA copyright enforcement.\n\nIf you have questions, comments, or concerns regarding this policy, \nplease e-mail riaa@informationwave.net <mailto:riaa@informationwave.net>.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOwen\n\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
