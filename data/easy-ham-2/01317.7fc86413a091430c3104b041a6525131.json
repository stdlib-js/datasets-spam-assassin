It runs as a standalone\napplication, using either the ALSA audio and MIDI sequencer system or the\nplain OSS devices. It can be played with an external MIDI controller\nkeyboard, a software virtual keyboard, or through a MIDI sequencer. All\nparameters can be controlled over MIDI. \n\nChanges: The ALSA driver has been MMAPed for improved performance.\nRecordings are now output to .wav files.

Both normal sized cases and\nslim cases are handled. cdlabelgen can be used to create table of contents\nfor music CDs, archival CDs, etc., with customizable logos or background\nimages, and it generates PostScript files as output. The package also\nincludes a Perl CGI Web script which accepts JPEG images as logos or\nbackgrounds, and can also create PDF output files.\n\nChanges: It is now possible to specify line width for the cover/tray edges\nor to omit edge lines entirely.

Despite being implemented entirely in Python, for reasonable\nrules on a modern machine, the system is capable of running thousands of\ngenerations per second. Lindenmayer systems are found in artificial\nintelligence and artificial life and can be used to generate fractal\npatterns (usually via mapping symbols from the alphabet to turtle\ncommands), organic-looking patterns that can simulate plants or other\nliving things, or even music. \n\nLicense: GNU General Public License (GPL)\n\nURL: http://freshmeat.net/projects/lsystem/\n\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\n\n[047] - LM-Solve 0.5.6 (Development)\n  by Shlomi Fish (http://freshmeat.net/users/shlomif/)\n  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 01:55\n\nGames/Entertainment :: Puzzle Games\n\nAbout: LM-Solve is a solver for several types of the puzzles present on\nthe Logic Mazes site.

Engelschall (http://freshmeat.net/users/rse/)\n  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 19:01\n\nSoftware Development :: Libraries\nSystem :: Operating System\nText Processing\n\nAbout: OSSP cfg is a ISO-C library for parsing arbitrary C/C++-style\nconfiguration files. A configuration is sequence of directives, each\ndirective consists of zero or more tokens, and each token can be either a\nstring or again a complete sequence. This means the configuration syntax\nhas a recursive structure and allows you to create configurations with\narbitrarily-nested sections. The configuration syntax also provides\ncomplex single/double/balanced quoting of tokens,\nhexadecimal/octal/decimal character encodings, character escaping, C/C++\nand shell-style comments, etc. The library API allows importing of a\nconfiguration text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), traversing the AST,\nand optionally exporting the AST again as a configuration text.  \n\nLicense: MIT/X Consortium License\n\nURL: http://freshmeat.net/projects/cfg/\n\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\n\n[060] - OSSP fsl 0.1.12 \n  by Ralf S.

Instead\nof writing to the syslogd process, it uses the powerful OSSP l2 logging\ncapabilities. It is a drop-in link-time replacement which enables any\nsyslog consumer to take advantage of OSSP l2 by just linking this library\nin before libc. The program is intended to apply OSSP l2 functionality to\nexisting syslog-based third-party programs without the requirement to\nchange the source code of the program.  \n\nLicense: MIT/X Consortium License\n\nURL: http://freshmeat.net/projects/fsl/\n\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\n\n[061] - OSSP l2 0.9.0 \n  by Ralf S.

It is based on the model of arbitrary number of\nchannels, stacked together in a top-down data flow tree structure with\nfiltering channels in internal nodes and output channels on the leave\nnodes. Channel trees can be either constructed manually through\nlower-level API functions or all at once with a single API function\ncontrolled by a compact syntactical description of the channel tree. For\ngenerating log messages, a printf-style formatting engine is provided\nwhich can be extended through callback functions. The data flow inside the\nchannel tree is controlled by logging message severity levels which are\nassigned to each individual channel.  \n\nLicense: MIT/X Consortium License\n\nURL: http://freshmeat.net/projects/l2/\n\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\n\n[062] - Papercut NNTP Server 0.8.3 \n  by Jo�o Prado Maia (http://freshmeat.net/users/jcpm/)\n  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:34\n\nCommunications :: Usenet News\nSoftware Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules\n\nAbout: Papercut is a multi-threaded NNTP server written in Python. Its\nmain objective is to integrate existing Web-based message board software\n(Phorum on the first few versions) with a Usenet front-end. However, its\nextensibility enables developers to write their own container for the\nstorage of the Usenet articles (messages). That means that the code is\nextensible enough that you could write new containers to integrate the\nnews server with other Web message board projects or even other ways to\nstore the messages. \n\nChanges: The various storage modules have been redesigned, and initial\ncode for NTTP authentication was added. New features include a standalone\nMySQL storage module with no Web front-end, an authentication module for\nPhorum, and the concept of a 'read-only' / 'read-write' server with\npassword protection. Most (if not all) of the features are working.\n\nLicense: BSD License\n\nURL: http://freshmeat.net/projects/papercut/\n\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\n\n[063] - PEANUTS 1.03 \n  by JP Durman (http://freshmeat.net/users/johnnyplayer/)\n  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 06:18\n\nSystem :: Systems Administration\nUtilities\n\nAbout: PEANUTS is a console-based Internet user  management system, which\nis perfect for  system administrators who normally do things  like adding\nvirtual hosts or new users by hand.

When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all reads\nand writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are\nintercepted. As a result, Valgrind can detect problems such as use of\nuninitialized memory, reading/writing of memory after it has been freed,\nreading/writing off the end of malloced blocks, reading/writing\ninappropriate areas on the stack, memory leaks in which pointers to\nmalloced blocks are lost forever, passing of uninitialized and/or\nunaddressable memory to system calls, and mismatched use of malloc/new/new\n[] vs. free/delete/delete []. \n\nChanges: Support for the x86 fldenv instruction, a fix for an obscure\noptimiser bug causing failures like this: \"insane instruction 27: PUTFL\n%ecx\", a fix for dying with bus errors running programs which mess with\nthe x86 AC (alignment-check) flag, fixes to make it compile and run on Red\nHat \"Limbo\" (7.3.92), a fix for a possible assert failure having to do\nwith free() when running cachegrind (not valgrind), and final manual\nadjustments. \n\nLicense: GNU General Public License (GPL)\n\nURL: http://freshmeat.net/projects/valgrind/\n\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\n\n[093] - VNC Reflector 1.1.9 \n  by Const Kaplinsky (http://freshmeat.net/users/const/)\n  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 03:49\n\nEducation\nSystem :: Systems Administration\n\nAbout: VNC Reflector is a specialized VNC server which acts as a proxy\nbetween a real VNC server (a host) and a number of VNC clients.

It\nsupports reverse host-to-reflector connections, it can save host sessions\non disk, and it also has other unique features.  \n\nChanges: Handling of host connections with different desktop geometries\nwas improved, and support for dynamic changes to desktop size was\nimplemented.
