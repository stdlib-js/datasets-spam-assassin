Worth FoRKing for the archives, too.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/business/yourmoney/28VENT.html?todaysheadlines=&pagewanted=print&position=top\n\n\nJuly 28, 2002\nVenture Capitalists Are Taking the Gloves Off\nBy LYNNLEY BROWNING\n\nThe venture capital world is looking less like a genteel club and more like\na brawling barroom.\n\nVenture capitalists are offering the companies they bankroll increasingly\nhard-knuckled deals that leave little wealth for a start-up's managers or\noriginal backers. The moves are leading some entrepreneurs, desperate for\nmoney, to decry today's investors as bullies. Some venture capitalists are\neven suing rival venture firms, asserting that the tough new terms are\nwiping out the value of their previous investments.\n\n\"People are playing hardball,\" said Ted Dintersmith, a general partner at\nCharles River Ventures, based in Waltham, Mass.\n\nThe bursting of the Internet stock bubble more than two years ago wiped out\nmany venture investments in dot-coms. Now, amid the bear market in stocks\nand limited prospects for investors or young companies to make money soon,\nventure capitalists are looking for novel ways to make money. As a result,\n\"private companies are facing the most onerous terms from venture\ncapitalists that we have seen in 20 years,\" said Steven E. Bochner, a\nsecurities lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif.,\nwho represents venture firms.\n\nIn the boom of the late 1990's, venture capitalists chose one of two\noptions. They could be paid back their invested capital, share in profits\nand receive dividends. Or they could convert their preferred shares into\ncommon stock when the private company held an initial public offering or\nwas sold. During that time of huge payouts for newly public and acquired\ncompanies, they usually chose No. 2.\n\nBut with markets now all but dead for initial public offerings and mergers\nand acquisitions, venture capitalists from Silicon Valley to the East Coast\nare increasingly demanding - and getting - both options. This \"double dip,\"\nknown as \"participating preferred,\" leaves far less potential wealth for a\ncompany's founders and previous investors. Venture capitalists are also\nnegotiating more deals with heightened \"liquidation preferences,\" in which\nstart-ups agree to pay back the initial investment at least two or three\ntimes over.\n\nPreviously, venture capitalists handed over money to a start-up in a lump\nsum. But more are now parceling out funds in tranches, and then only when\nthe new companies reach certain milestones - a sales target, for example,\nor the hiring of a particular chief executive.\n\nThey are even trying to protect their investments through veto rights that\npermit them to block future investments from other venture capitalists who\nmight dilute their stakes, said Mark G. Borden, chairman of the corporate\ndepartment at Hale & Dorr, a law firm based in Boston. As a result, Mr.\nBorden said, a start-up company that casts its lot with a particular\nventure capitalist or group of investors may find itself tethered to those\nbackers and unable to raise new money elsewhere.\n\nENTREPRENEURS particularly dislike one recent trend: venture capitalists\nhave been pushing young companies to agree, retroactively, to lower the\nprices that investors now pay for shares should the start-up be worth less\nwhen it tries to raise more money later. Such a move, known as a \"full\nratchet,\" is intended to prevent an investor's stake from being diluted.\nBut it can significantly reduce or even wipe out the stakes of a company's\noriginal investors and managers, giving the new investors most of the\ncompany for a song.\n\n\"If you were in the first round of investors, you generally now get\ncrushed\" when a start-up raises more money later, said J. Edmund Colloton,\ngeneral partner and chief operating officer of Bessemer Venture Partners,\nbased in Wellesley Hills, Mass.\n\nConsider Mahi Networks, a private optical networking start-up. In three\nrounds of financing, from September 1999 to November 2001, Mahi raised $110\nmillion from blue-chip venture firms like Benchmark Capital, Sequoia\nCapital, the GE Capital unit of General Electric and the venture arm of\nGoldman Sachs. At one point during the Internet boom, Mahi was valued at\nmore than $180 million.\n\nLast month, though, a new group of smaller-name investors, led by St. Paul\nVenture Capital of Minneapolis, acquired about three-quarters of the\ncompany for $75 million in financing. Before that, Mahi was valued at only\n$25 million, said Chris Rust, Mahi's president and chief executive. But\nmost of that was tied up in employee incentives, including stock options,\nleaving almost no value for existing investors.\n\nDespite having nurtured Mahi with money and advice, the early investors\nchose not to back the company further. With the new, lower valuation,\n\"there was effectively no value attributed to all of our previous\ninvestments,\" said one venture capitalist whose firm was an early backer.\n\"We were all completely washed out\" in the last round, said the investor,\nwho spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThere is no hard data on the prevalence of the newer, tougher terms.\nVenture capitalists are famously secretive about their deals, which are\nprivate and largely unregulated. But ask venture capitalists or securities\nlawyers who work with start-ups, and tales of onerous terms will abound.\n\"At the end of the day, the money is coming with strings attached,\" said\nMark G. Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, a\ntrade group based in Arlington, Va.\n\nThe shift has turned the conventional wisdom on its head. Venture\ncapitalists once loved risk, but no more. The Internet bust and Wall\nStreet's slump have left them scrambling to make money to repay their own\ninvestors and to justify their management fees.\n\nVenture capitalists once clamored to be first in the door of a hot new\ncompany. Now they can usually make money only by being the most recent\ninvestor. \"We're certainly looking for later-stage deals, where you get the\nbenefit of the previous investors having taken the risk,\" said Todd Dagres,\na general partner at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass.\n\nSome entrepreneurs agree to the harsh new terms simply because they have no\nother way to raise cash to survive. But other managers now shun the\ninvestors, whom they call \"vulture capitalists,\" bent on picking the meat\noff a young or struggling start-up. Today's venture capitalists \"want to\ntake advantage of you,\" said George R. Waller, chief executive of Strike\nForce Technologies, an employee-financed software maker in West Orange,\nN.J. Mr. Waller said he had turned away 30 venture firms in recent months\nbecause they had demanded, among other things, hard-to-reach sales\nmilestones.\n\nGeorge J. Nassef, chief executive of ValetNoir, a start-up based in New\nYork that makes marketing software for casinos, said several venture firms\nhad even asked in recent months to have their potential investments secured\nwith receivables, or money owed to ValetNoir by its customers. He turned\nthem all down.\n\nNOT surprisingly, the shift in financing terms is upsetting some venture\nfirms that were early investors in start-ups but are now suffering as the\ncompanies seek to raise additional money at bargain-basement prices.\n\nIn one high-profile case, Benchmark Capital, a blue-chip Silicon Valley\nfirm, sued the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Juniper Financial\nthis month. Benchmark was an early investor in Juniper, an online financial\nservices concern, having put $20 million into it in early 2000, just before\nthe Internet bubble burst. It also contributed to a second, $94 million\nround that September. Juniper, based in Wilmington, Del., is seeking to\nraise $50 million from Canadian Imperial, which already owns around half\nthe company, but on terms that would sharply dilute Benchmark's original,\nunspecified stake. Benchmark sued to prevent the start-up from raising the\nmoney. All the parties declined to comment on the case, which a Delaware\njudge threw out last week.\n\nSuch friction was rare during the boom, when venture capitalists operated\nlike a competitive but tight-knit fraternity, channeling deals to one\nanother. Start-ups and their backers saw their interests as allied. But in\ntighter markets, \"there's a lot of ugly behavior coming out,\" said Mr.\nBochner, the Wilson Sonsini lawyer. \"There's going to be much more\nlitigation like this.\"\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
