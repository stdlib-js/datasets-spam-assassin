Turns out, these 419 scams (419 is the statute in Nigeria that this particular form\nof fraud falls under) have actually snared a few people -- NPR reported to the tune of 100 million dollars over a few years, in the US alone.\n\nOne website listed the 419 scam as being the 'third to fith largest industry in Nigeria' (1), netting billions of dollars\nfrom around the world.   Its large enough to warrant a governmental investigation and a special number to call and report\n(to the secret service, no less) scam abuse. (2)   Folks are apparently being held for ransom if they decide to go\n'check out' the scam.  (3).\n\nListen to the NPR article (4).   What's great about NPR is the commentary at the end. Turns out, this is all unbelievably\ncommon.   The origination, at least to NPR's knowledge, starts with the scam elements being transposed from Nigeria,\nto London, England.   Instead of the bereved widow of a Nigerian national, the originating con was directed to the 'heirs'\nof Sir Frances Drake's estate.   If you were 'chosen' as an heir, you could contribute a portion of your money so that a\nfellow heir (and scam artist) could reclaim the monetary largess in the Court of England, by proving that Elizabeth I had\nnulled Sir Drake's will and taken his fortune as her own.   Oscar\nHartzell, the gent who started this scam, way back in the early 1800s,\nmanaged to gain quite a fortune, all on the backs of idiots.   Sound familiar?\n\nA fool and his money, deserve to be parted. \n\n(1) http://home.rica.net/alphae/419coal/\n(2) 'If you have received a letter, but have not lost any monies to this scheme, please fax a copy of that letter to\n(202) 406-5031.'
