Abolins\" <jda-ir@njcc.com>\nSubject: Aussie paper: US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen\n  spies\n\nAnybody ever heard of Pavlik Morozov? (If not see \nhttp://www.cyberussr.com/rus/morozov.html for a quick blurb about the \nfellow.) When I see proposals to mobilize American people into being eyes \nand ears fo the government, I am reminded of Pavilik and his family.\n\nNow I am not against people reporting certain things to the police. It is \nthe habit of being constantly suspicious of neighbors, co-workers, and \notehrs that can become destructive. Down the line it can lead to suspicions \nbased not on significant clues but upon things such as \"fails to display \nsufficient respect for authority\", \"laughs whenever the phrase 'homeland \nsecurity' is used\", and \"hangs out with anti-social misfits.\" It is an all \ntoo easy slide from neighbors watching out for each and helping the \ncommunity to becoming agents of the state.\n\nJ.D. Abolins\n\nPS: Why is it that the most revealing news reports about the USA are coming \nnowadays form the UK, Aussie, and other non-USA media? <rhetorical>\n--------------\n From the Sydney Morning Herald Web site 15 July 2002\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/14/1026185141232.html\n\nUS planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spies\nBy Ritt Goldstein\nJuly 15 2002\n\nThe Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States citizens \nas domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil liberties groups.\n\nThe Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will \nhave a higher percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany \nthrough the infamous Stasi secret police. The program would use a minimum \nof 4 per cent of Americans to report \"suspicious activity\".\n\nCivil liberties groups have already warned that, with the passage earlier \nthis year of the Patriot Act, there is potential for abusive, large-scale \ninvestigations of US citizens.\n\nAs with the Patriot Act, TIPS is being pursued as part of the so-called war \nagainst terrorism. It is a Department of Justice project.\n\nHighlighting the scope of the surveillance network, TIPS volunteers are \nbeing recruited primarily from among those whose work provides access to \nhomes, businesses or transport systems. Letter carriers, utility employees, \ntruck drivers and train conductors are among those named as targeted recruits.\n\nA pilot program, described on the government Web site www.citizencorps.gov, \nis scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 million informants \nparticipating in the first stage. Assuming the program is initiated in the \n10 largest US cities, that will be 1 million informants for a total \npopulation of almost 24 million, or one in 24 people.\n\n[...]\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPOLITECH -- Declan McCullagh's politics and technology mailing list\nYou may redistribute this message freely if you include this notice.\nTo subscribe to Politech: http://www.politechbot.com/info/subscribe.html\nThis message is archived at http://www.politechbot.com/\nDeclan McCullagh's photographs are at http://www.mccullagh.org/\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike Politech?
