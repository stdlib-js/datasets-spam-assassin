The people who were saying that it\ndid not happen did not see the fadeout in progress. It only came back\nafter the server was rebooted properly. However improbable it seemed at\nthe time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the\n.ie zonefile. As a result it, there was nothing in the file that the\nsecondaries picked up. At the time, I thought that the file was on an\nNFS. But if it regenerated after reboot, and the NFS input was not\nthere, it would have generated a blank zonefile - that makes some sense.\nHistory now but it has an alarming relevance. :)\n \n> As an aside, shortly after my note on Friday uucp-gw-1.pa.dec.com and\n> uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com stopped responding to DNS requests.

The nameservers themselves had connectivity problems from\nwhat I could see and it was going on for a while, even *after* the\ninitial SOA problems. \n\nI am thinking of writing a simple .ie secondary state monitor for\ninclusion on WhoisIreland.com as these guys seem to be technologically\nincapable of running their own DNSes. What kind of distorted logic hands\nthe admin of a national tld to a company that does not even handle DNS\nfor its own domain? Whatever selection process IEDR used should be\ninvestigated by the relevant government department, especially as the\ncompany supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR did not\nactually spot this loss of synch. The IEDR contract with the company\nshould be reviewed in the light of this event. This kind of 1 week loss\nof synch should not happen with a national domain. Ireland as E-hub -\nmore like e-jit central! :)\n\nRegards...jmcc\n-- \n********************************************\nJohn McCormac            * Hack Watch News\njmcc@hackwatch.com       * 22 Viewmount, \nVoice:   +353-51-873640  * Waterford,\nBBS&Fax: +353-51-850143  * Ireland\nhttp://www.hackwatch.com/~kooltek\n********************************************\n\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nVersion: 2.6\n\nmQCNAzAYPNsAAAEEAPGTHaNyitUTNAwF8BU6mF5PcbLQXdeuHf3xT6UOL+/Od+z+\nZOCAx8Ka9LJBjuQYw8hlqvTV5kceLlrP2HPqmk7YPOw1fQWlpTJof+ZMCxEVd1Qz\nTRet2vS/kiRQRYvKOaxoJhqIzUr1g3ovBnIdpKeo4KKULz9XKuxCgZsuLKkVAAUX\ntCJKb2huIE1jQ29ybWFjIDxqbWNjQGhhY2t3YXRjaC5jb20+tBJqbWNjQGhhY2t3\nYXRjaC5jb20=\n=sTfy\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n_______________________________________________\nIIU mailing list\nIIU@iiu.taint.org\nhttp://iiu.taint.org/mailman/listinfo/iiu\n\n\n"}
