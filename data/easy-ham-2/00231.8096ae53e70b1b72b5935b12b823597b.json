The installation of Linux\nMandrake didn't afford me that luxury.\n\nAlso, I'm glad you cleared up the fdisk issue.  I know better now --\npreviously I was under the impression that fdisk had a hidden switch. \nThis is obviously not the case.\n\n-- \nNote: When you reply to this message, please include the mailing\n      list and/or newsgroup address and my email address in To:\n\n*********************************************************************\nSigned,\nSoloCDM\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
