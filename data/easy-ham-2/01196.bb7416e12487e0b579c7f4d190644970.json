(I've made a\nstart, but there's a fair amount of work to do.)\n\nIf this works out, I might start a repository for the freshrpms compiled\non vLatest RawHide, for my own purposes and anyone else who's\ninterested.\n\nDave.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
