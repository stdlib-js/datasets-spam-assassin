Push never came to\nshove (at least, not yet :-) ) but my understanding of the situation vis a\nvis software is that in the absence of any contract granting ownership of\nthe code to another party, it remains with the person who wrote it. I didn't\ntake legal advice on this but my customer did :-) and his lawyer told him\nthat I was right and would most likely win in court.\n\nSo much for the ownership of the code vis a vis you and your client - now for\nthe GPL issues. \n\nCode compiled by a compiler which is GPL software (e.g. gcc) is not itself\ncovered by the GPL unless its author chooses to make it so. This is perhaps\nnot made clear enough in the GPL text and is a particular piece of FUD which\nMicrosoft loves to toss about. Similarly, the copy of PHP which is part of\nyour customer's system is covered by the GPL. You can charge him whatever\nyou like for it but you must provide him with acces to the source code, and\nyou cannot restrict what he can do with it (in this case, move it to another\nservice provider). However, you have not (I take it) chosen to license YOUR\ncode under the GPL so the conditions of the GPL do NOT apply to it.\n\nIf OTOH you had written some code which modified PHP as such, and then\ndistributed (whether for a fee or not) that modified PHP, then the modified\ncode must be licensed under the GPL. But this applies to a modification to\nPHP itself and NOT to your scripts which run under PHP.\n\nThe relevant clause is 2(b) which says (though Lord knows why I'm quoting when\nlocate COPYING will turn up a shedload of copies of the GPL on just about\nany Linux box - 540 on this box)\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\nin part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\nlicensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\nthis License.\n\n\nYour PHP scripts do not contain, nor are they derived from, PHP, in whole or\nin part.\n\n> I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated\n\nMicrosoft has very much made this a Linux issue - it has attempted to imply\nthat any company using GPL software must make everything it owns public and\nit must be true - that nice man from Microsoft wouldn't lie, would he ?\n\n\n\nNiall\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
