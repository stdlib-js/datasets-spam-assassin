They sold it anyway, and kept records.\n\nIn the US, we eventually got quite friendly with squatters and adverse\npossession, and integrated out extra-legal arrangements and 'spontaneous\nsocial contracts' into the official law.\n\nMr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work.\n\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nDave\n> Long\n> Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 2:17 PM\n> To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org\n> Subject: RE: The Curse of India's Socialism\n> \n> \n> >                                                                   In\nthe\n> > Philippines, getting legal title can take 20 years.
