The guy said something like this: \"it's an evil binary that only\nruns on one system\", so I took the hint :)\n\nNOTE: I think I understand why RPM makes you go thru the whole build process: prep,\npatch, build, install, package ... there are ways to get around this, but the\npackage would not be \"from pristine sources\" so to speak. I read that the 1st big\nchange they made to RPM was to always use \"pristine\" sources, then have prep apply\nthe packager's patches; whereas the early RPMS were already RH patched, apparently,\nnot having the \"pristine\" sources as the author had released them.\n\nJust a guess ... ???\n\nGary Peck (gbpeck@sbcglobal.net) wrote*:\n>\n>On Wed, Aug 14, 2002 at 10:14:18PM -0700, Jesse Keating wrote:\n>> On Wed, 14 Aug 2002 22:03:36 -0700\n>> Gary Peck <gbpeck@sbcglobal.net> wrote:\n>>\n>> #\n>> #The closest I've gotten is to use \"rpmbuild -bi --short-circuit\" but\n>> #that falls one step short of actually creating the rpm files.
