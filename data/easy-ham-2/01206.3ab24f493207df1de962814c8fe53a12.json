Although that would require other \napplications to use GConf as well .\n\nHaven't installed Limbo beta2 myself - been sidetracked by work; the \nfact that the computer I'm installing it on is connected to a dodgy USB \nADSL modem that requires heavy kernel patching means that I would have \nto do it over a weekend - but I don't think Red Hat currently does it \nfor its config tools.\n\nRegards,\n\nMichel\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\nhttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n"}
