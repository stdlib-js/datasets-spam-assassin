One \nperson answered GlibC. This got me thinking about GCC itself, so I asked on \nanother list and got a few answers, most were \"don't even think about it\" but \na few suggested GCC and one pointed me to Linux From Scratch.\n\nAfter having a good search around the lfs site, I've decided I'm going to \ngive it a whirl. I've got a spare box and loads of free time, so why not ;-)\n\nThe lfs site, however warns NOT to use optimizations when compiling GCC or \nGlibC? A quick google found PGCC, a Pentium optimizing patch for GCC, but the \nsite does not seem to have been updated in quite some time?\n\nSo, my general plan, and I'm taking my time with this:\n\nPartition the hard drive for the lfs set-up with 4 partitions, /, /usr, /var \nand /home.\nInstall a base Debian system into the /home  partition so I can build the \nrest of the system into the other partitions.\nUsing Debian, build the initial packages into the / and /usr partitions. I'll \ntry to optimize GCC and GlibC in this first stage.\nchroot to the / partition and re-build the base packages for shared libs.\nstrip de-bugging from the binaries and change the boot so the system boot \nfrom / rather than /home, then move /home to it's proper partition.\n\nAll going well, I should now have a full base Linux system running that is \nfully optimized for my PentiumMMX including GCC and GlibC.\n\nNow I can build zlib and then X, again optimizing. And I can follow this with \nthe various graphics libs, qt lib and finally KDE.\n\nIf all goes well, I will probably repeate this for my Dual system, once I can \nfind a match for the slot1 550Mhz PIII Iv'e got.\n\nI might even be tempted to write this up for the site.\n\nCheers,\n\n\tJohn Gay\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
