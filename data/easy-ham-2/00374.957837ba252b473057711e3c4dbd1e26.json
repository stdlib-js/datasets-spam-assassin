There's even a tarball[1] with this\nspecifically in mind.  The people who built\nthe Ximian version of RedHat used a system\nsimilar to said tarball.\n\nBuilding a distro which uses a *BSD ports\nsystem rather than rpm, deb or whatever\nwould complicate things a tad more IMHO.\n\nIt *is* a good idea though.  I've been \nwondering about the same thing for a couple\nof months now but always considered it too\ncomplicated to carry out. (If that makes any\nsense at all).\n\nI don't discount any other work like for \nexample Niall's work on the B.B.C. but maybe\nthere is general interest in an Irish distro.\nAnyone?\n\nRegards,\nShane.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: wintermute [mailto:cout@eircom.net]\nSent: 13 August 2002 00:48\nTo: ilug@linux.ie\nSubject: Re: [ILUG] SUSE 8 disks?
