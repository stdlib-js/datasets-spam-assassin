Red Hat, for example, ships with everything\nyou need to build a modified distribution.  And it's all GPL (or free\nenough).\n\n> There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, \n\nAhem.

Taking a regular distribution like\nRed Hat or Debian and tweaking it for Ireland - things like translations,\nISP setups, default bookmarks.\n\nNever took off.\n\nWhy not try it yourself.\n\nLater,\nKenn\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
