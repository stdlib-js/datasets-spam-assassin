I\nthink that whichever organization (Irish government I suppose) is in\ncharge of promoting Irish here could learn a lot from them. \n\nThe Basque government used to pay MS for translating Windows, but they\ngot pissed off because it was extremely expensive and the translations\nwould come out when the software was already obsolete. Now they promote\nFree Software while helping the language at the same time, I think it's\na win-win situation ;).\n\ncheers,\nArkaitz\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group Social Events: social@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/social for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
