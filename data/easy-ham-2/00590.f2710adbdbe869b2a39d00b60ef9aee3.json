It makes no difference what the list is, whether it's run by ZDNet\nor Empire Towers, whether it uses open proxies and relays or a MLM like\nmailman or Lyris. In either case I was added to a list against my will to \nreceive unsolicited bulk email. I shouldn't have to 'just unsubscribe from\nthe list' any more than I should have to send email with the subject REMOVE\nto removemeblahblah1234@yahoo.com or go to http://www.centralremovelist.com/\nto 'unsubscribe' from some viagra spam.

But my point is that neither person in my example was\ncommitting an inherently untrustworthy act. Yet someone's TES would likely\nfall because of it.\n\n> Razor is designed for the betterment of most people, i.e. the majority, \n> not for the individual.

Good point about razor-whitelist. I'd forgotten about that.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nTabor J.
