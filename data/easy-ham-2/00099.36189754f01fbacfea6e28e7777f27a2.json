Since the first build, \nI've been encouraged to play with the CVS of both XFree86 and the DRI stuff, \nso I will be re-building X once we get some bugs worked out.\n\nFinally I built KDE3.0BETA1 from sources I had, again to take full advantage \nof the MMX processor.\n\nCan anyone recommend other minimum tools that I should re-build to get even \nmore improvements in system performance? I know that not all packages can, or \ndo benefit from being built on PentiumMMX rather than the i386 that Debian \ncompiles to, but have I covered everything that CAN benefit?\n\nI am wondering if the C, and other libraries  should be re-built? Can they \ntake advantage of the Pentium and MMX instructions for system performance? \nAnd would this require re-building gcc as well?\n\nI realise that not everything can benefit from re-compiling. I.E. I doubt I \nwould see much system improvement if I re-compile bash, but things like the \nkernel, X and KDE should improve performance.\n\nOn a related note, I know I've mentioned here before, but I'm still looking \nfor a Slot 1 550Mhz PIII. My regular system is a Dual PII350 and the 440BX \nM/B can take PIII's. I managed to get my hands on one. If I could get another \nI could put the two PIII's into this box and re-compile X to use the \nSSE/Katmai instructions in the PIII. I just don't thing it is worth replacing \ntwo PII's with one PIII. I know that they are out-of-stock, and I do watch \nthe Buy-N-Sell regularly, but short of buying a full PIII system, I've not \nhad much luck.\n\nCheers,\n\n\tJohn Gay\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
