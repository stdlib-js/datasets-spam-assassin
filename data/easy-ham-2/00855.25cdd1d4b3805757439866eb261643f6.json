I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed\n>> (especially those with multiple email addresses...).\n>\n> What's the point of multiple email addresses? They're a pain.\n>\n\n\nAh the great spam debate wages on ...\n\nSo where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-)\n\nEugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is\nthat I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school\naccounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of\nmail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go\nthrough it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends\nthat go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into\nthe friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )  \nIts still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I\nhaven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my\ncarey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets\nconsiderably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down.\nWhen I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or\nwhatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even\n_better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change\nmy mind on the multiple email address thing.   I still like knowing that I\ncan send the assholes (or undesirable guys I don't feel like dating ;)  to\nmy @hotmail account.\n\nI'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only\nfork.   As snobby and elitist as a member-only FoRK would be, I'm starting\nto feel the pain of the whole spam to bits ratio on fork.   I'd be\nwilling, multiple email addresses and all, to sign up for a whitelist\nprovided the system could handle email sent from say cnn.com that was\nreferenced to my address (say the On Behalf of) emails that a few of us\ntend to send.   Does such a system exist?  I'm rather ignorant on the\nwhole whitelist concept, and I know a few of you are far far more\nknowledgable.\n\nMy half a cent here...\n\n<sidenote>: I will be so damn glad when I am done with this whole moving\nthing... back on fork when I'm in NH.. :)\nWoo hoo!   Law school!)   </sidenote>\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
