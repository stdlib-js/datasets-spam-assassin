Personally, I think it's the sort of reprehensible behavior that\nsplit Unix way-back-when into the mess it was in a few years back, before\nLinux...got rid of most of them.\n\n Vendors wrote their own wierd-ass installers & config tools to lock\npeople to their OS, they added all sorts of functionality that was not\navailible to other OSes to make themselves different from the competition\n(Motif on non-free OSes, incompatible filesystems etc).\n\n While a good idea when you share code & standards, in an environment\nwhere you do neither, the user suffers.\n\nKate\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
