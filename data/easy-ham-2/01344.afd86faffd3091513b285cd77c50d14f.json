I've seen that term used on\n>this list before...\n\nSure.  I described it the way I understand it to another person off \nlist a little while ago.\n\n\nIt has a couple different definitions.  The most common is Luser \n[sic] Attitude Readjustment Tool.  It was first used to describe the \nreporting of spam to ISPs that didn't think spam was bad.  Their \nattitude needed a little readjusting.  It has since taken on the \ngeneric meaning of reporting email/security incidents to the \nappropriate parties.  Somewhere the definition is online.  I can't \nseem to find the page though.\n\n\nLART is about as good a word as any to describe reporting \nRumplestiltskin attacks.  Come to think of it, I generally get a much \nbetter response to spam LARTs than I do to LARTs for other things. \nI'm always careful to say in the LART that the massive amounts probes \non our system disrupted service to our customers and that we \ntherefore consider it a DoS attack.  That tends to ellict a better \nresponse.  I also either include a log snippet in the email or I dump \nit to a file and make it accessible on a web server with other logs \nof hosts that abused our mail server.  That helps too. :)\n\nJustin\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?
