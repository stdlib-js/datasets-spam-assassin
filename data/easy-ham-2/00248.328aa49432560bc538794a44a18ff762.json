Western France, La Rochelle\narea.

Given\nthat this monitor was serving as the single monitor for 4 boxen (via a\n4-way vga KVM switch), I'd be looking at investing in 4 DVI cards along\nwith another KVM to suit while a VGA version _should_ just plug into\nplace. \n\nConor\n-- \nConor Daly <conor.daly@oceanfree.net>\n\nDomestic Sysadmin :-)\n---------------------\nFaenor.cod.ie\n  5:20pm  up 72 days,  2:37,  0 users,  load average: 0.08, 0.02, 0.01\nHobbiton.cod.ie\n  5:19pm  up 14 days, 23:42,  1 user,  load average: 0.01, 0.04, 0.00\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
