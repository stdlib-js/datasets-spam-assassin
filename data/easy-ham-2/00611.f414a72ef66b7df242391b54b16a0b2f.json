This is the\nnature of the spam problem. Now if you were to use a \"personal trust\"\nsystem, you'd have a huge personal trust group that would include 99% of\nthe userbase. This means 99% times you'd be coming to the same conclusion,\nonly after burning several orders of magnitude more CPU cycles. That would\nbe stupid. Also, it would take several orders of magnitude longer to\nbootstrap and reach effectiveness. Sub-optimal in the extreme.\n\nAs regards to the problems with the \"gray\" areas you mentioned, servers\nrecognize such content, and razor-agents can use this information to make\nindividual determination. Not to mention, users can set a local confidence\nlevel they are confortable with.\n\ncheers,\nvipul.\n\nOn Thu, Aug 08, 2002 at 01:09:22PM -0700, Craig R .
