CDs.\n\nYou'll probably want to buy a retail boxed set, e.g., via mail order.\nThe only editions of SuSE for i386 that are lawful to duplicate and\nredistribute are as follows:\n\nSuSE Evaluation:  This is a single-CD ISO9660 image, currently at v. 7.0. \nIf you don't mind having only one disk's worth of SuSE, and being\nseveral revisions behind the boxed-set editions, this is quite good and \nrecommended.\n\nSuSE Live Eval:  Another CD image, currently at v. 8.0, but this one\ndoesn't install to hard drives at all:  It's a demo disk.\n\nSuSE FTP Edition (for lack of an official name):  Not a CD image, but\nthe contents of ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/current/ .  You would\nhave to mirror the ftp directory tree, and then figure out how to\ninstall (e.g., over NFS).  Currently at v. 8.0.\n\nThere are three (non-redistributable) boxed-set editions, at different\nprice points.\n\nI'm assuming in the above that you're talking about an i386-architecture\ncomputer.  Slightly different answers apply for Alpha, IA64, SPARC, PPC,\nSPARC64, PPC64, or S390.\n\n-- \nCheers,                   \"Teach a man to make fire, and he will be warm \nRick Moen                 for a day.
