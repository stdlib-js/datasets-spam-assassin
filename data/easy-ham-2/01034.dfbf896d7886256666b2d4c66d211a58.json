The Diesel is close enough to the Elm St starbucks for me\nto get reasonable net throughout most of the cafe. \n\nThe rumor is that they'll be announcing that they've got boston covered on\nthe 21st.  I've heard from at least one source that they're actually going\nto announce a much wider national rollout at that time.  It's not cheap [1], but\nfor soemone like me who's running a ~virtual corporation, it's well worth it.\n\n[1] https://accounts.tmobilebroadband.com/net_offers_promos.htm\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Aug 15, 2002 at 04:51:07PM -0400, Luis Villa wrote:\n> On Thu, 2002-08-15 at 16:38, Jesse wrote:\n> > Strata just walked up to me in a cafe in Somerville, MA and\n> > asked me how I was getting net here.
