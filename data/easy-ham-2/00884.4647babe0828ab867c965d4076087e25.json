Pay no attention to the bear\nbehind the curtain, and all that.\n\nHowever, at the end of the *last* bear market, in 1983 -- yup, that\nlong ago -- Granville sell-orders caused bloodbaths with boring\nregularity, a stockholm-syndrome economy had recently been delivered\nof Keynesian monetary apparatchiks at the Fed and elsewhere, and\nHenry \"Dr. Doom\" Kauffman opined offhand that interest rates *might*\ncome down finally... and pop! went the market, sending the NYSE\nvolume through the roof. (Record volume then was around a hundred\nmill. Yesterday, ladies and germs, it was upward of 2 point something\n*billion* shares).. Back then, I was a mail-cart-pushing,\nkey-punching \"administration\" clerk at Morgan Stanley in Chicago,\nchief scrounge for a bunch of Masters of the Universe, and everybody\nat Morgan thought the resulting price-pop was just a technical rally\nand wouldn't last either. :-). Six months later, people *still* said\nit wouldn't last, and a girlfriend's uncle was saying that it was too\nlate, he'd missed the train, so he was going to stay out 'till the\nmarket came back down a bit. By that time, the Dow was at, what,\n1600? I wonder if he's still out, waiting...\n\n\nA 40% decline is a big chunk of change, boys and girls, even if it's\n40% of a bubble. Actually, by my count, it's 100% of the bubble, but\nthat's just me. After all, Amazon and EBay's P/Es still need a\npressurized cabin to breathe in.\n\nSo, yes, the market may go lower, but not much more, relatively\nspeaking. At some point, and fairly soon, I bet, someone's going to\nrealize that, even though you wouldn't want to actually trade one for\na house, tulips are still nice things to have around.\n\nHint: Interest rates are rediculuously low, they aren't going up any\ntime soon, and, if we can survive the election, the recently-started\nCEO witch-hunt won't be too much more than Street theater, probably\nnot resulting in much in the way of regulation or legislation. The\nthreat of which, frankly, probably caused this recent explosive\ndecompression in the first place. Your tax dollars at work, if you\nwill.\n\nSo, in light of the erstwhile bloodbath on Capital Hill, and the real\none we just saw a few days ago in the market, it may be time for\npeople to remember what Mr. Rothschild said, and buy now while\nthere's blood in the streets.\n\nAs to whether the accounting is \"rigged\", remember what Robert\nHeinlein said: \"Who cares if the game is rigged? You can't win if you\ndon't play.\"\n\n\n\nCheers,\nRAH\nThe aforementioned girlfriend, by the way, traded *me* in for an\nactual Rothschild in 1984, after I insisted on going back to school\nand talking my way into the back door at the University of Chicago to\nboot. The cost of anything being the foregone alternative, it\nsometimes seems to me I'm *still* paying for that detour, but that's\na bear of a different color, and it's okay as long as I don't look\nbehind the curtain, right? :-).\n\n- --- begin forwarded text\n\n\nFrom: Somebody Else\nTo: \"R.
