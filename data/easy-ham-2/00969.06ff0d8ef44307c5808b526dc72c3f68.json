Once the control chart has\n> been established, data is recorded on it and it becomes a record\n> of the variation of an inspected dimension over a period of time.\n> The data plotted should fall in random fashion between the control\n> lines, if all assignable causes for variation are absent.  When the\n> data fall in this manner, it can be assumed that the part is being\n> made correctly 99.73% of the time; that is, no more than 3 out of\n> 1000 will leave the process incorrectly made.\n\nTaking a look at the S&P 500, and \nusing the Ibbotson 2000 figures of\n13% expected stock return and 20%\nstandard deviation, and taking the\nthe actual 2.5 year return on the\nS&P since 31 Dec 1999 to be close\nto -30%, we find:\n\n-.30 ? 2.5*(.13) - 3*sqrt(2.5)*(.20)\n-30% > -60%\n\nso it still plots out between the\ncontrol lines ...\n\n> So long as the points fall between the control lines, no adjustments\n> or changes in the process are necessary.  If five to seven points fall\n> on one side of the mean, the process should be checked.  When points\n> fall outside of the control lines, the cause must be located and\n> corrected immediately.\n\n... but maybe we should've checked\nthe process during the \"long\" bull.\n\n-Dave\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
