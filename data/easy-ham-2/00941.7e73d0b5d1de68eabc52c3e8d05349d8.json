I'll never understand.\n\n\nThe primary desert warfare facilities and schools ARE in the Southwest,\nmost notably Fort Irwin deep in the Mojave/Anza Borrego (the\nheadquarters and core training facilities for all things desert warfare\nrelated), and have been for a long time. There are two reasons that\nimmediately come to mind as to why they do not use the Fort Irwin,\nEdwards AFB, and other expanses of desert that they have traditionally\nused for desert warfare training and exercises.  \n\nThe first is logistical: Virtually all the mechanized infantry units are\nlocated east of the Rockies, and it must be very expensive to move\nentire heavy combat divisions a couple thousand miles every time they\nwant to run training exercises.  This is particularly true since so much\nof our military is made up of reserve components these days, meaning\nthat you can't move the soldiers to where the training facilities are.\n\nThe second is environmental lawsuits and pending judicial action and\ninjunctions. The desert training facilities in the Southwest deserts\nhave been aggressively assaulted by environmental organizations who are\nmaking the case that heavy mechanized units zipping back and forth\nacross the deep desert endanger the desert tortoise and a bunch of other\ntheoretically endangered species that are concentrated in the southwest\ndeserts. The ability of the military to use the desert facilities has\nbeen significantly impeded these days while all the lawsuits and whatnot\nwith the various environmental groups are being sorted out.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
