I'm\nasking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to\nburn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange\nfor a reasonable consideration (say, the price of\nthe CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a couple of\npints?).\n\n\nWhat does the GPL mean now?\n\n\nI don't want their 60 days of free email support\nor anything similar (if I did, I would pay for\nit).\n\n\nPaul...\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!? -- Une adresse @yahoo.fr gratuite et en fran�ais !\nYahoo!
