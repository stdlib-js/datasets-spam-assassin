The first order approximation would be to just add \nusing pack .... -side top instead of pack ... -side left, however, since their \neach a different width, it would look funny.\n\n> > I have space for more sequences, in the \"unseen\" window, as long as they\n> > remain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be\n> > ordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall\n> > off the bottom, and not be shown).\n> > \n> > I'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring,\n> > just one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with\n> > background black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or\n> > other decorations, but made \"sticky\" - the appearance is just like the\n> > folders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the\n> > root window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around\n> > and do I can see when new mail needs processing).\n\nThe background color in this window is the same as the background \ncolor in the ftoc.\n\n> > I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur\n> > in one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).
