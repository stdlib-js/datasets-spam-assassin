My authority isn't much better than \"they say\", but they\nsay that they've uncovered quite a few advantageous mutations in the ethnic\nEuropean genome that protect against quite a few different diseases,\nmutations which are not found in various African, Asian, and other\npopulations that they also study.  Based on the genome research (as it\nrelates to infectious disease, which is among their primary interests) of\nthese various populations around the world, they and others are finding far\nmore protective mutations in the Caucasian/European genome than in the other\nrace populations they survey.  All the races and ethnic subgroups usually\nhave genetic mutations specific to them that provide protection against\nspecific infectious diseases.  What they are saying is that they are finding\nfar more in the European genome than in the others, and it isn't because\nnobody is looking elsewhere.\n\nYou can find studies and results like this in the science wires.  For\nexample, one which I remember off the top of my head is the identified\ngenetic mutation that makes something like 1% of Caucasians immune to HIV-1,\nand another 10-20% or so resistant to it.  Obviously, the protective\nmutation occurred at some point in time prior to HIV-1 being introduced into\nthe European population.  What the researchers I've talked to seem to be\nsaying is that Europeans express a lot more of these types of gene\nmutations, with similar protections from infectious disease, than other\npopulations.  Nobody really knows why for sure.  On the upside, identifying\ngenetic immunities to infectious disease helps the bio-techs come up with\npharmacological solutions for people that don't have immunity.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
