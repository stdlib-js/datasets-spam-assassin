Between\nMandrake/YellowDog, RedHat/SuSe and Debian you have enough options to cover\nmost day-to-day requirements. And a lot of the specific situations are\nalready covered (smoothwall, familiar, etc.)\n\nTherefore, if I were to create a new Linux distribution, I would have to\nspend time crafting it so that it offers a lot more than existing\nalternatives. My requirements normally involve better support/easier\nmaintenance, and if one follows the logic through, this would require a\ncompany to be behind such an initiative.\n\nI imagine it would be possible to create a new distribution in about one\nweek[1]. For example: take Debian as your base, slap a specific set of\npackages on CD, change a few config files, mention that it has been untested\non most hardware variations, and voila, a \"new\" distie. :)\n\n- Matthew\n\n[1] That is, IT weeks. 1 IT week ~= two months. :)\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\nhttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
