You cannot win the legal way, because the\ngeek is a minority, and even not a lobby-toting minority at that. You\nCannot Win That Way. Really.\n\nWe need an uncensorable, hardened P2P infrastructure to distribute such\nstaples as open source software.  Software patents are tragedy of the\ncommons all over again. The collateral damage done by pirating is a\ncomplete footnote in comparison to the radioactive glass iron-fisted IP\nrights enforcement habitually produces.\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
