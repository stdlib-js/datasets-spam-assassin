Last night I upgraded to Limbo II (.93).\n\nInstalled Limbo II kernel, Installed libstdc++ from rawhide (rpm -ivh) so the\nnewer apt would work, told apt it is OK to have multiple of libstdc++, copied\nthe actual rawhide \"libstdc++.so.5.0.0\" file to another directory, removed that\nrawhide libstdc++ package, installed (rpm -ivh ) the Limbo II libstdc++ package\n(new apt does not like it), make that symlink \"libstdc++.so.5\" point to that\nrawhide file I moved earlier.\n\nApt works again, dump the Limbo II rpms into a dir, run the \"genaptrep.sh rh73\",\nbut \"topdir\" arg had changed, edit script, rerun, makes apt repository for Limbo\nII. Do \"apt-get --ignore missing -f dist-upgrade\". Apt wants to uninstall itself\nbecause that rawhide libstdc++ package is not installed, but apt works for the\nmoment because of that symlink I made.\n\nApt stays installed just long enough to issue the necessary \"dist-upgrade\"\ncommands, several hours later, I have Limbo II, shiny and new. The install even\nmade that symlink point back to the correct libstdc++ file.\n\nSeveral hours after that, I read my mail and realize that \"null\" directory I kept\nseeing while downloading Limbo II was not a fluke.\n\nAhh, the joy. Repeat the above ....\n\n--\nThat's \"angle\" as in geometry.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n"}
