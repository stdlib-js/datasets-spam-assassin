(Confused yet?) Unfortuantely these tools don't\nhave a gui frontend, but since the workhorse is a wrapper for mkisofs,\nthat shouldn't be too hard for someone who knows how to do those things.\n\n> Also, a bootable DVD of Red Hat Linux 7.3 would be great as I've still not\n> burned the CDs even once for myself since I always install through the\n> network (and haven't found an easy way of purchasing an english boxed set\n> here in Spain...).\n\nWell that was an image I put together of just the first three disks of\nthe distro. Make it bootable too. Fun, but slower than a network\ninstall.\n\n-- \nChris Kloiber\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n"}
