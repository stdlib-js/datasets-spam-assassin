For the most part, people become wealthy by not being stupid.  I\nalways thought \"not being stupid (most of the time)\" was a fairly low\nbar, but apparently most people can't even manage that.\n\nThat is really what it all boils down to:  There are lots of ignorant\nand/or stupid people who are quite happy to stay that way, and it is a\nkey causal factor in why things are the way they are.  What are you\ngoing to do about it?\n\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
