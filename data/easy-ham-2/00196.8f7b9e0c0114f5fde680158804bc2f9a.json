[ ... ]\n  | google is a bit of a dead too.\n  | \n  | Can anyone tell me what I should do?\n\n I've no idea, but a relevant/useful source of info could\n be the «linux-utf8» e-list:\n\n     http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html\n     http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/\n\n whilst the list is nominally about UTF-8/Unicode and Linux,\n it often delves into related areas (such as input methods).\n\n my (vague!) understanding of the state-of-play is there are\n multiple ways of keyboarding scripts such as \"Chinese\", and\n the choice of method is a mixture of personal preference,\n equipment (e.g. your keyboard), and the tool/application\n in question.\n\n w.r.t. X11 applications, it seems to boil down to two\n approaches:   one unique to the tool itself (apparently\n `yudit' is famous for this);  or  else using what's called\n an XIM (X Input Method).\n\n  WARNING: I am now guessing quite a bit here, based mostly on\n           my interpretation of what I've read whilst lurking,\n           and watching a few people keyboarding a Japanese\n           script years ago!   *** your mileage will vary! ***\n\n XIMs generally work as a complex compose frontend.  i.e., you\n build up your character as a series of composes of the root or\n fundamental strokes (\"radicals\", I think they are called), and\n then \"commit\" the composite character to the application.\n ( yes, keyboarding these scripts _is_ quite slow, I believe\n  a good typist can only do a few characters a minute!\n  and I assume using a qwerty keyboard is very painful. )\n\n some XIMs compose \"in place\", others do it on a special line,\n and some seem to do it in a special window (or the root?).\n also, some(/most?) XIMs apparently support a US-ASCII input\n mode as well --- _not_ a general Latin-alphabet input mode,\n which seems to require another TLA, called KBD, and which\n apparently doesn't work when an XIM is also being used? ---\n implying you have to switch back and forth between US-ASCII\n input mode (what us English-speakers would call \"normal\"\n keyboarding/typing), and the other input (e.g., Chinese).\n I'm not sure, but I have the impression the switch is often\n a toggle, and something like <Control><CapsLock>.\n\n many apologies if this is completely wrong or too misleading.\n\ncheers!\n\t-blf-\n\np.s.  b.t.w., you almost certainly want to be using a UTF-8\n      locale.  if RH 7.3 is the so-called \"limbo\" release,\n      then you may quite possibility be using one by default.\n\n--\n«How many surrealists does it take to    |  Brian Foster    Dublin, Ireland\n change a lightbulb?
