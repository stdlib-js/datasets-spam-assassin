The additional number (and associated bars and\nspaces) is enough to make checkout scanners seize up and\nmake computers crash, perhaps disrupting entire supply\nchains. \n\nBut many retailers have yet to focus on a problem that will\nrequire significant investments in time and capital. \n\n\"Most retailers are public companies that tend to live\nquarterly and not look ahead, which means they are going to\nbe hit over the head with this and have to scramble at the\nlast minute to avert disaster,\" said Thomas Friedman,\npresident of Retail Systems Research Services, a company in\nNewton, Mass., that publishes a retail information\ntechnology newsletter. \n\nLeading retailers say they have begun to address the issue.\nA spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest\nretailer, said the company had \"embraced the concept\" of an\nexpanded bar code, but he did not respond to questions\nabout actual measures taken to prepare computer databases\nand logistical systems. Similarly, a spokesman for the\nTarget Corporation said his company was \"intellectually\nready\" for the change but refused to comment on whether any\nof its stores or warehouses were technologically ready. \n\nBut Richard A. Galanti, the chief financial officer of\nCostco Wholesale, admitted, \"The truth is, given the\ntimeline, everybody's still in the assessment phase, trying\nto figure out what to do.\" \n\nThe difficulty is similar to the one posed by the Year 2000\ncomputer problem, when computer software had to be switched\nfrom two-digit entries identifying years to four-digit\nentries. Before Jan. 1, 2000, millions of lines of code had\nto be rewritten to avoid widespread computer failures. \n\nBar codes have been used in packaging since 1974, when the\nfirst item, a pack of chewing gum, was scanned at a\nsupermarket in Ohio. The codes identify a product,\ndistinguishing between an eight-ounce can of Del Monte\ncreamed corn and a medium-size pair of Hanes boxer shorts.\nWhen a bar code is scanned, the information in the store's\ndatabase lets the retailer assign a price and track sales\nand inventory. \n\n\"The bar code is the linchpin upon which everything in\nretail depends,\" Mr. Friedman said. \n\nThe reason for expanding the 12-digit bar code, known as\nthe Universal Product Code, is twofold. First, there is a\nshortage of U.P.C. numbers. \"There's only a certain amount\nof 12-digit numbers, and we're going to run out,\" said John\nTerwilliger, vice president of global markets at the\nUniversal Code Council, a nonprofit organization based in\nLawrenceville, N.J., that assigns codes in the United\nStates and Canada. Second, 13-digit bar codes are used\nalmost everywhere else in the world. The council's European\ncounterpart, EAN International, based in Brussels, assigns\nthese numbers, called European Article Numbers, to\ncompanies in 99 nations. \"Right now,\" Mr. Terwilliger said,\n\"foreign importers have to get a 12-digit U.P.C. to do\nbusiness over here, which they haven't been too happy\nabout.\" \n\nForeign manufacturers currently pass on to consumers the\ncost of getting an additional bar code and creating special\nlabels for products sold in the United States and Canada.\n\"It's an added expense for them, and they have to recoup it\nsomewhere,\" said Debra Shimkus, marketing manager at the\nChicago Importing Company, a specialty food importer whose\noverseas suppliers are often incredulous when they are told\nthey have to get new bar codes for their products before\nthey can be sold in American groceries. \n\nMany foreign manufacturers decide that it is not worth the\ntrouble. \"A lot of companies have been unwilling to accept\nthe additional burden,\" Mr. Terwilliger said, \"and have\nstayed out of the market entirely.\" \n\nAmerican and Canadian exporters have not had the same\nobstacle because foreign retailers can easily incorporate a\n12-digit number into their 13-digit databases by making the\nfirst digit zero. That is why American and Canadian\nmanufacturers of products that now have 12-digit codes will\nnot be affected by the code expansion. A two-liter bottle\nof Coca-Cola, for example, will keep the same U.P.C., but a\nzero will be added to the beginning of its bar-code number\nin retailers' product databases. \n\n\"The effect of the change in the U.P.C. code falls squarely\non retailers,\" said Mr. Friedman. He estimates that the\nupgrade will cost at least $2 million for a chain of 100\nstores with 10 checkout lanes a store. \n\nThe expense will vary depending on the age of a retailer's\ndatabases, software and hardware and whether it has to hire\noutside consultants to make the change. Scanners and other\nhardware bought more than three years ago will not read\nlonger codes and will have to be replaced. Software more\nthan five years old will also have to be scrapped. \n\n\"Thank God we'd already planned to buy new equipment for a\nlot of stores this year,\" said Richard S. Gilbert, director\nof store systems at Duane Reade, a chain of 200 drugstores\nin New York City. The stores have a total of 3,500 scanning\ndevices, each costing $1,000 to $2,500. As for the\ncumbersome database modifications that need to be made, Mr.\nGilbert said: \"Our consultants say they are working on it,\nbut they haven't gotten back to me with a plan. I still\ndon't know how big a deal it's all going to be.\" \n\nHe might want to ask John Poss. Mr. Poss is the\nmerchandising coordinator for Ace Hardware, which has 5,100\nstores and sells some 65,000 coded products. Ace overhauled\nits computer systems to accept longer bar codes in 1999.\nThe company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., has retail outlets\nin 70 countries and more than a hundred foreign suppliers. \n\n\"It was such a struggle to get manufacturers to relabel\nthings for North America,\" Mr. Poss said, \"and we wanted\nthe same system in place globally, so we decided to make\nthe change.\" \n\nThe company hired a consultant, Cognizant Technology\nSolutions, which is based in Teaneck, N.J., and is a\ndivision of Dun & Bradstreet. Ace's in-house team worked on\nthe project during the day while a Cognizant office in\nIndia took over at night. \n\nEven so, the project took almost two years to plan and\ncarry out. In addition to equipment upgrades, modifications\nhad to be made in more than 500 software programs in\nvarious company divisions (50 in distribution alone). The\nmost tedious and time-consuming part of the conversion, Mr.\nPoss said, was making adjustments to databases. \"Every\ndatabase in every division touches bar code information,\nand they all needed to be reworked,\" he said. \"It's like\nY2K, where you had to go in and expand fields and find\nevery reference to the date.\" \n\nThough Mr. Poss would not disclose the cost of the project,\nhe said the gains in efficiency and in suppliers' good will\nhad been \"well worth the expense.\" His advice to other\nretailers is to \"get busy because you're facing an extreme\nchallenge.\" \n\nBut moving to 13 digits may not be enough. The Universal\nCode Council and EAN International, which formed an\nalliance in 1996, strongly advise manufacturers and\nretailers to go a step further and prepare their systems to\naccommodate a 14-digit code. That is the length of a newly\npatented bar code that takes up less space. Its reduced\nsize means that it can be affixed to small items like loose\nproduce, and the extra digits let a retailer keep track of\nadditional data like batch and lot numbers. \n\nThat additional information would make product recalls\neasier. \"Today,\" Mr. Terwilliger said, \"once a product is\ntaken out of the shipping container in the warehouse, you\nreally can't track it anymore.\" \n\nShipping container bar codes are already 14 digits. The\ndifferent bar-code standards mean that retailers need\ndifferent computer systems for shipping and receiving,\ninventory and sales. By adopting a 14-digit standard,\nretailers should be able to put all the information into a\nsingle database. \n\nMr. Poss said Ace had added the capacity to scan and store\n14 digits when it made its conversion three years ago. \"Now\nwe can scan anything,\" he said, \"whether it's in the\nwarehouse or at the register, and it immediately goes in to\na centralized system. No more sending data between\ndivisions.\" \n\nThe cost and work of making the transition to 14 digits, he\nsaid, was the same as it would have been for a change to 13\ndigits. \n\nRepresentatives from the standards groups said adopting a\n14-digit structure - a step for which no date has been set\n- could help streamline the sharing of data among all parts\nof a retail operation. It would also make it possible, they\nsaid, to identify products anywhere in the world at any\ntime during the trade process. \n\n\"And to think it all started with pack of gum,\" Mr. Poss\nsaid. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/technology/12CODE.html?ex=1030208144&ei=1&en=1b5705e7bd2048e6\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
