We should try to stop them. You\nseem to have forgotten this in your moral relativism. Everybody is\njustified in their own head. This doesn't mean we forgive mass murders,\nor ignore their acts. They are still guilty and abhorrent. We do\nunderstand them better when we see them as a flawed human being, like\nany one of us.\n\n> When both sides can call the other \"evil\" to the cheers of their local\n> public and media, you can bet something's rotten in the state of Denmark.\n\nCalling \"the other side\" evil is a time-honored tradition. It is less \nof a stepping point for an analysis of the situation than it is for an\nanalysis of human nature in general.\n\n> I guess that's why I live in the woods.
