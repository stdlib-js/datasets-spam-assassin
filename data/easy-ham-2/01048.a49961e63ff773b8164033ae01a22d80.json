By showing that it can be done,\nthey inspire others to follow in their path, or so they hope.\n\nI take some objection to the belabouring of the term fantasy, because it\nis somewhat perjorative. Imagining different worlds can often lead the\nworld to become more like that imagined. Moreso if action is taken on\nthe basis of those imaginings.\n\nTheres an interesting parralel with the great capitalist dream that\nanyone can make anything happen through hard work and a bit of luck.\nThis is equally a fantasy, but one made to approach reality through\nconsensus.\n\nAn interesting question then becomes, if Al Queda's actions are in\nfurtherance of a fantasy, what fantasies are George Bush's actions in\nfurtherace of? How many of the actions of George Bush and the US are\nperformed for their effect on the US population? For example, how much\nshowmanship has been put into rebuilding the morale of wall street. Is\nthis not as much a spirtual investment as the sacrifices Al Queda made?\n\nWhat cultural myopia is in play here in the US?\n\nI make a point of reading Australian, Britsish and US news. Today I\nnoticed that the Australian and British news are featuring the Iraqi\novertures to the UN on inspectors, while US news is featuring Iraqi war\npreparations (digging bunkers etc).\n\nAt a time that the US is withdrawing from international cooperation on\nmultiple levels, the fantasy of being surrounded by enemies (invisible\npreferably) is somewhat appealing. A self fullfilling prophesy, if you\nlike. Perhaps that's whats at work here.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
