But I'm natural, baby.  My parents\nwere attracted to each other's phenotypes, mixed some genes in the\nhopes that those genotypes would get in there, and grew me around\nthem.  Sure, they engineered the process when they selected each\nother.  But they didn't engineer the genetics.  If genetic enginering\nwasn't such an important topic today, it wouldn't be such an important\ndistinction.\n\nI guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing\nagainst any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument -\n\"we've been doing it since prehistory, so we don't need to apply any\ncaution today\".\n\n-- \nKarl Anderson      kra@monkey.org           http://www.monkey.org/~kra/\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
