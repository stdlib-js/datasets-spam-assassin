Companies that have taken on way too much debt can\nscrew their shareholders and even some of their debt-holders by\ndeclaring bankruptcy, as Enron and Worldcom have done; meanwhile,\nit becomes more difficult for individuals who have similarly taken on\ntoo much debt, to dig their way out of their own holes...\n\nIn my next life, I'm coming back as a corporation.  They get all the\nperks. :)\n\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/27/business/27BANK.html\n\nA Sudden Rush to Declare Bankruptcy Is Expected\nBy PHILIP SHENON\n\nWASHINGTON, July 26 The compromise bill, which was approved on Thursday\nby Congressional negotiators and is expected to be adopted in both the\nHouse and Senate by the end of next week, will make it much harder for\nAmericans to wipe out their debts when they declare bankruptcy.\n\nAfter the agreement, lawyers around the country said that they had begun\nto receive calls and visits from debtors worried that they needed to\nfile bankruptcy before the old rules lapse next year.\n\n\"I've had plenty of calls this morning,\" said Gary F. Weltmann, a\nconsumer bankruptcy lawyer in Washington. \"And I'm telling people that\nthey need to take action now.\"\n\nMarty K. Courson, a bankruptcy lawyer in San Francisco, said he was\n\"getting ready for the onslaught.\"\n\n\"I do think there will be a lot of people trying to use the old rules,\"\nhe said.\n\nThe White House announced today that President Bush would sign the bill,\nwhich was scheduled for a final vote in the House late tonight and in\nthe Senate next week. \n\n\"The president looks forward to signing that,\" said Ari Fleischer, the\nWhite House spokesman. \"That bill enjoys widespread bipartisan support\nfor good reasons.\" \n\nThe bill, which had been stalled until this week in a House-Senate\nconference committee, passed both chambers by overwhelming margins more\nthan a year ago. The conference committee approved the bill Thursday\nafter agreeing on an abortion-rights provision that had been the final\nobstacle to passage; the provision will bar anti-abortion protesters\nfrom using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying court judgments as a\nresult of clinic protests.\n\nThe bill has long been the top legislative priority of the credit card\nand banking industries, which say that many people now abuse the\nbankruptcy system by writing off debts that they should be able to\npay. There were 1.45 million bankruptcy filings last year, a record, up\n19 percent from 2000.\n\n\"This legislation restores integrity and accountability to our\nbankruptcy system by offering a fresh start to those who deserve one\nwhile cracking down on those who don't,\" said Representative F. James\nSensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House\nJudiciary Committee.\n\nCritics, including top consumer-rights groups, described the bill as a\ngift to lenders in exchange for a recent, drastic increase in campaign\ncontributions to members of Congress. They also said that it would do\nharm to millions of Americans in financial distress as a result of lost\njobs, poor health or divorce.\n\nThe bill's opponents have also questioned the timing of its passage,\nwhich comes in the midst of a Congressional crackdown on abusive\naccounting practices by many of the largest companies, including some of\nthe same financial services companies that have lobbied strenuously for\nthe bankruptcy bill.\n\n\"The timing couldn't be worse,\" said Travis B. Plunkett, the legislative\ndirector of the Consumer Federation of America. \"It takes a lot of gall\nfor Congress to make a move like this when so many Americans are\nconcerned about corporate abuses, and when the economy is so shaky.\" \n\nSenator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who is a leading critic of\nthe bill, said today that \"it boggles the mind that at a time when\nAmericans are more economically vulnerable, when they are most in need\nof protection from financial disaster, we would eviscerate the major\nfinancial safety net in our society for the middle class.\"\n\nBankruptcy lawyers said that the bill would do harm to low- and\nmiddle-income clients who would be saddled with debts that would take\nthem years to pay back. The new law will end the debt-free \"fresh start\"\nthat many of those debtors had been permitted under the current law.\n\nRecent studies have shown that the average American filing for\nbankruptcy has a median household income well below the national average\nof about $42,000 in 2000. A study cited in Congressional testimony last\nyear showed that the average person filing for bankruptcy had a car that\nwas six to nine years old, and that a quarter of those people had\nmedical debts exceeding $1,000.\n\n\"I won't deny that there are people who abuse the bankruptcy system,\"\nsaid Mr. Weltmann, the Washington lawyer whose firm calls itself the\nBankruptcy Center. \"But there are honest, hard-working folks who are\nreally going to be affected by these changes.\"\n\nThe bill would impose a means test on debtors, based on median incomes\nin their home states, for bankruptcy filings under Charter 7 of the\nfederal bankruptcy law, which permits debtors to erase most of their\nunsecured debts, like credit card bills.\n\nDebtors with an income above the state median would be barred from\nfiling under Chapter 7 and would instead be required to file instead\nunder Chapter 13, which requires that a portion of the unsecured debt be\nrepaid over time under the court-administered plan.\n\nMr. Courson, the San Francisco lawyer, said that the changes would \"hurt\na lot of consumer debtors who really, rightfully belong in Chapter 7.\"\n\n\"My clients, for the most part, are honest and unfortunate people, and\nthey've just got heavy debt,\" he said. \"You can always find some\ncircumstance where a person really went to town with a credit card and\ngot themselves in trouble. But I have people who are just plain old\npoor. My experience is something wildly different than the story that\nthe credit card companies make to Congress.\"\n\n\n----\naDaM@XeNT.CoM -- .sig double play!\n\n\nAt its peak, there were more than 100 peer-to-peer start-ups. There now\nremain, at most, a couple of dozen companies concentrated in a few\nniches. The main activity of companies venturing into peer to peer is\nfile sharing. But the dozens of overoptimistic forays into alternative\neconomic systems, hyper-sophisticated technologies, and recording\nindustry collaboration turned out to be dead ends.  Peer-to-peer\nauctions, peer-to-peer supply chain management, and peer-to-peer e-mail\nmay have failed because they were ahead of their time. It's more likely\nthey failed because they were just ahead of themselves.  Clearly, the\npublic's appetite for file sharing has increased, and the state of the\nart has improved dramatically. But companies have still not yet found\nsatisfactory business models, thus leaving file sharing's last chapter\nunwritten.\n  -- Gene Kan, http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/zd/20020710/tc_zd/942734\n\n\nXML proxies are add-ons to firewall and network environments that have\nthe ability to monitor XML traffic and apply business rules and IT\npolicies such as security, routing, performance, management,\ntransformation, and connection provisioning.  Current firewalls aren't\nable to peek in the envelope and decipher XML traffic, said report\nauthor Ronald Schmelzer, ZapThink senior analyst.  XML proxies are not\nonly able to understand network protocols, but also the XML-based\ncontent traveling on top of those protocols, Schmelzer said.  ZapThink\nidentifies a slew of new vendors with XML-ready security solutions,\nincluding Flamenco Networks, Forum Systems, Reactivity, Vordel, and\nWestbridge Technology, among others... ZapThink estimates that XML\nrepresents just 2 percent of network traffic today, but that will\nincrease to almost 25 percent by 2006.\n  -- http://www.internetwk.com/story/INW20020726S0004\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"}
