Especially in the languages he was talking about - C, Pascal and\nAssembler. Goto's can be used well; there are a few used in the kernel\ncode to improve efficency. They are almost required in some languages\n(like C) where 'break' or 'continue' can't be told how many loops/switches\nto break out of.\n\n But, in general, goto's make a mess of code.\n\n> Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto \n> or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of \n> programming syntax\n> to make sure people use loops or recursion?\n> <<To iterate is human, to recurse divine>>\n\n Recursion is only truely useful if you have an infinite stack. People\nthat think they have an infinite stack shouldn't be let near a compiler.\n\n> Kind of makes you wonder about things considered to be 'good'.  For\n> example people bang on about polymorphism, but is there actually any\n> advantage in using an overloaded function based on class inheritance?\n\n I don't care, to be honest.\n\nKate\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
