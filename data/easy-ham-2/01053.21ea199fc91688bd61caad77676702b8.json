I've heard Bush say this (verbatim)\nGLM> more than once, and with a straight face.\n\nPersonally, I don't know where you got that from.  Here's how I\ngrokked the whole piece.   A theory (in this case, that fantasy was\nthe propagating force/drive?) behind a given act, that from those not\nin the fantasy seems morally outrageous, repugnant or unjustified.\nHe listed many examples, oldies and goodies.   I don't think the\nauthor meant to come off at the point that you seem to be\nconjecturing -- that this is purely an 'other' offense.   I certainly\ndidn't read it that way, but it _did_ bother me that he did not\ninclude some of the examples I listed, or as Damien? mentioned on an\nearlier post, the whole collective fantasy of capitalism.\n\nGLM> Call it gay-bashing or whatever, it's convenient tunnel-vision and\nGLM> lies to justify violence against a creature genetically, morally and\nGLM> intellectually indistinguishable from your sister.  Go ahead, peel the\nGLM> skin off a random daughter of each of them and lay them side by side\nGLM> on the pavement, and you tell me which one was racially guilty, which\nGLM> one carried the \"infection\" the \"plague\" (note, not the \"antigen\" or\nGLM> the \"hormone\", which have similar metaphoric effects to philosophy,\nGLM> but they chose the fear-charged words)\n\nThis article never got into the bones & blood of what humans are Gary.\n  You're assuming too much, dearie.  His was all a psychological game.\nI'd be willing to wager that, his point was merely psychological.\nThat there is a distinguishing characteristic (the fantasy) about\nthose who are perpetually deluded into a preconceived notion of how\nthe world needs to work -- his examples were very clear -- a\npsychopathological individual and on a lesser extreme, the father who\nfantasizes his son as a football player.   I kinda read 'levels' into\nthat distinguishing characteristic though.   Meaning, just because\nyou believe in the/a fantasy, does not mean necessarily that you're\ngoing to be an evil terrorist.   It just means you're playing alittle\ngame in your head, and because of that you are a bit different from\nthe rest of the wavelengths floating around in the cosmos at that\nmoment.\n\n\n\nGLM> \"Make no mistake about it\" it oozes rhetorical vehicles to obfuscate\nGLM> it's lack of bits paragraph after paragraph in pushing an agenda to\nGLM> /excuse/ \"our\" violence and suspension of human rights to 'clense'\nGLM> ourselves of \"them\", the 'non-human' (or lesser-human) objects of its\nGLM> hate.\n\n\nI didn't read cleanse or nonhuman anywhere.   Mind telling me where\nyou saw those words?   Sure, I'll bite that the article had rhetoric.\nI'll also bite that he wasn't fair entirely with his theory.   If he\nmeant it to be a universal (capable of including even the common\nfather with a football complex dream) he should have included our\ndelusions in all of this.   But honestly, where in the hell did you\nget 'cleanse ourselves of 'them', the 'non-human' (or lesser-human)\nobjects... ?\n\nGLM> What else shall we call it?  Just anti-liberal?  \n\nLots of things can be anti-liberal and not be bad.  :)\n\nGLM> Better question: What if, as in physics, the laws of human behaviour\nGLM> are the same everywhere in the Universe?  What if Al Queda is in fact\nGLM> more like our mafia or biker gangs or school board trustees? \n\nWell, as sinister as the schoolboard is, they didn't go kill 4k+\npeople.   Lets put some of this moral relativism de jour into\nperspective here.   Al'Qaeda had a fantasy.  This fantasy involved a\nwhole mess of 'others' not in their collective fantasy.   This _is_\nmuch like the mafia's collective fantasy about brotherhood and\norganized crime, or the biker gang's fantasy about being badasses on\nthe road or the school board's fantasy about indoctrinating your\nchildren with Jesus, but its not equivalent.\n\nThe terrorists went out, and purposely destroyed things, and killed\npeople.   This is bad, I don't care what universe you're in.   While\nthe aspect of 'fantasy' can be applied to all groups, and that label\ncan be equivalent, the perpetration of the fantasy has different\neffects and must be judged differently.   Otherwise, whats a genocide?\nJust a father-son complex gone terribly awry?\n\nGLM> What if they operate by the same neural-annealing Maxima-Minima\nGLM> gratification mechanisms as you or I and every other creature on this\nGLM> planet?  \n\nThey just may, that doesn't dispute that their fantasy was a deadly\none.\n\nGLM> What if, instead of magically and uniquely alien, they are, just like\nGLM> our own captains and leaders, really only in it for the money, for\nGLM> trade rights-of-way and for power over minions who will foolishly make\nGLM> it all happen, minions whom they can once again dup with /virtually/\nGLM> /identical/ rhetoric ... except we call theirs \"fundamentalist islam\",\nGLM> and they call ours \"imperialist satanism\"?\n\nGLM> When both sides can call the other \"evil\" to the cheers of their local\nGLM> public and media, you can bet something's rotten in the state of Denmark.\n\nSo your whole point is we too live in a fantasy.  Sure.   No\nquestions.  Its the thing that bothered me about the article.   I\nthink the difference between our fantasy and theirs, is that there are\nfolks out there, in our fantasy allowed to voice their opinons about\nthe 'fantasy' and keep folks a bit grounded in the real versus the\nmade-up.   From what I gather, there are no such guards, or\nprotections on their end.   Thats the problem with some regeimes over\nothers.   THey all have bad points -- Ours is in a collective fantasy\nthat we need to control the oil, masking the intentions behind a very\nclever, albiet convienent other fantasy of 'terrorism'.   Point is,\nGary, the 'terrorism' fantasy really happened.  People really died.\nI won't argue we're innocent in the perpetration of our fantasy, but\nI'll argue that we're not just blindly 'cleansing' 'non-humans'.\n\nGLM> I guess that's why I live in the woods.  Bears and racoons I\nGLM> understand, but I really just don't 'get' people.\n\nToo bad bears and racoons don't protect you from the silly fantasies\nof people, yours or others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
