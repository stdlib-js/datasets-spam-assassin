If my brain can detect the crosstalk from a call-center before \nthe human, sub-human, or machine starts speaking, why not have a box that \njust hangs up for me?  Maybe it could blow a police whistle (play a \nsample) into the phone first.\n\nCurrently, a strategy of leaving the machine on as a screener works pretty \nwell, but I still get Carey-on-RIAA style mad when the damn phone rings \nand it's NOT anyone I want to talk to.\n\n.....\n\nI want to like Spider Robinson's works.  Really.  I mean having a \"Bridge \nof Birds\" attraction in the \"China that never was\" portion of the theme \npart in \"The Free Lunch....\"   But, I really fell for his anti-paparatzi \ndevice (invented by a princess Diana fan).   Doggone.  I've now completely \nreasoned my way around it.  It has a built-in defense against the first \nobvious way of confounding it, but that leads directly to an exploit that \nuses off the shelf hardware that a paparatzi ought to have in her kit.\nThat's so often the problem with Robinson.  He doesn't think that you the \nreader are nearly so smart as he.  Heh.   I admit that reading a lot of \nslushpile manuscripts does not improve one's opinion of fellow-man, but\nI always resent him for not being thorough.\n\nEirikur\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"}
