It works pretty well and I have not had\nmajor issues with it. There are minor problems: like the serial console\ndrivers, but for workstation installs I suspect it will work fine.\n\nAnd you get a working version of your favourite KDE/Gnome desktop instead of\nDTE, uhm, I mean CDE.\n\n> Basically the whole installation procedure is\n> \"boot net - install\"\n\nWell, you have to add the workstation to the install server first.\n\nTalking of which, you can install Sparc Linux using this technique as well.\nThe image takes a while to load, but once this is done you can install in\nthe normal fashion.\n\nSuSe for Sparc works fine. I am using Debian because the Sun boxen I have\nsubverted do not have graphics consoles. It also just works.\n\nIf you have a spare workstation, I am sure I could burn a couple of CD's for\nyou. (If I can find them.)\n\n- Matthew\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\nhttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
