It not only risks silent false \npositives, but suffers them in such a way that \nindividuals cannot adjust/detect/remedy them. \n\nAlso, anti-spam startups need end-users. \nCentralized spam fighting takes food out\nof those coders' mouths!\n\nI still think self-add whitelists are underrated. \nA FoRK whitelist would presumably start with\nall subscribers, and grow from there. Bouncing\nproblem mail, in a way that humans can understand\nhow to whitelist themselves for a resend, avoids \nthe problem of silent failures without opening the \ndoor to lazy, forged-\"from\" spammers. \n\n- Gordon\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Rohit Khare\" <khare@alumni.caltech.edu>\nTo: <fork@spamassassin.taint.org>\nSent: Tuesday, July 23, 2002 12:25 PM\nSubject: Re: HD/ID: High-Def Independence Day\n\n\n> On Sunday, June 30, 2002, at 12:18 AM, Rohit Khare wrote:\n> > You're all invited to join me for a South Bay Hi-Def spectacle at my \n> > apartment in Sunnyvale on the Fourth!\n> \n> So here's the final report on the HD/ID party.
