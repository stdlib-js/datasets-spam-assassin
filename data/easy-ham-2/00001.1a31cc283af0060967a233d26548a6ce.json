There's obviously a way as the \"Sequences\" menu does this.\nThe \"Mark Unseen\" menu entry in the message \"More\" menu is still wanting\nthat function as well...\n\n  | For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to\n  | display the other sequences.\n\nAny chance of having that lengthen instead?   I like all my exmh stuff\nin nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached\nfolder list, one column.   The main exmh window takes up full screen,\ntop to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...\n\nI have space for more sequences, in the \"unseen\" window, as long as they\nremain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be\nordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall\noff the bottom, and not be shown).\n\nI'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring,\njust one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with\nbackground black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or\nother decorations, but made \"sticky\" - the appearance is just like the\nfolders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the\nroot window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around\nand do I can see when new mail needs processing).\n\nI also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur\nin one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).  So in addition to\nthe \"sequences to always show\" and \"sequences to never show\", a\npreference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder\nwould be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the\nfolder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current.\nThis is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining\nproductive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message\nin a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message,\nit gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is\npacked, sorted, etc).\n\nI haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this\nnext one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the\nbar with New Flist Search ...) only contains \"unseen\" and \"urgent\".\nIt would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder\nhappens to have defined.   A \"New sequence\" entry would also be useful\n(to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist,\nwhich can be done now using \"Search\" and the pick interface, but is\nclumsy that way)\n\nActually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name\nin the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the\nlist of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ...\n\nsyntax error in expression \"int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))\"\n    while executing\n\"expr int($minlineno+1+($msgid-$minmsgid)*($maxlineno-$minlineno-2)/($maxmsgid-$minmsgid))\"\n    (procedure \"Ftoc_FindMsg\" line 46)\n    invoked from within\n\"Ftoc_FindMsg $msg\"\n    (procedure \"Ftoc_FindMsgs\" line 5)\n    invoked from within\n\"Ftoc_FindMsgs $msgids\"\n    (procedure \"Ftoc_PickMsgs\" line 5)\n    invoked from within\n\"Ftoc_PickMsgs $pick(ids) $pick(addtosel)\"\n    (procedure \"PickInner\" line 13)\n    invoked from within\n\"PickInner {exec pick +inbox -list} {4852 -sequence mercury}\"\n    (\"uplevel\" body line 1)\n    invoked from within\n\"uplevel #0 $cmd\"\n    (procedure \"busyCursorInner\" line 8)\n    invoked from within\n\"busyCursorInner $cmd $widgets\"\n    (procedure \"busyCursorHack\" line 32)\n    invoked from within\n\"busyCursorHack $args\"\n    (\"cursor\" arm line 1)\n    invoked from within\n\"switch $busy(style) {\n\ticon\t\t{busyIcon $args}\n\tcursorAll\t{busyCursor $args}\n\tcursor\t\t{busyCursorHack $args}\n\tdefault\t\t{eval $args}\n    }\"\n    (procedure \"busy\" line 3)\n    invoked from within\n\"busy PickInner $cmd $msgs\"\n    (procedure \"Pick_It\" line 51)\n    invoked from within\n\"Pick_It\"\n    invoked from within\n\".pick.but.pick invoke\"\n    (\"uplevel\" body line 1)\n    invoked from within\n\"uplevel #0 [list $w invoke]\"\n    (procedure \"tkButtonUp\" line 7)\n    invoked from within\n\"tkButtonUp .pick.but.pick\n\"\n    (command bound to event)\n\nIt has been ages since I did this last though.   I tried adding a Subject\nto pick on (easy as I know what's in the message...) which made no difference.\nLooks as if something is now saying \"1 hit\" when before it didn't, or\nsimilar.\n\n  | I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a \n  | week or so ago.\n\nAny chance of making the current message a little brighter background?\nJust to make it stand out a fraction more than it does (maybe this is\nmore apparent to me than many, as I use very small fonts everywhere,\nthe background of the ftoc line isn't very wide).\n\nHope this helps.\n\nkre\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n"}
