You can then set up KMail to use various\nidentities automatically when replying to messages which match a\nparticular pattern, or which are in a particular folder, etc.  It's\nall very cool, and it works very nicely.\n\nBut I still don't know how to do it in Mutt.\n\n             Colm\n\n-- \nColm Buckley | colm@tuatha.org | +353 87 2469146 | www.colm.buckley.name\nA dirty mind is a terrible thing to waste.\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
