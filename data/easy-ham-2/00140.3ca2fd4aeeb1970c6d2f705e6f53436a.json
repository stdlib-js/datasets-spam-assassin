Pulled it and spent a while playing with gcc, and after a \nfew false starts got it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the \nkernel. There's a boatload of stuff that still needs cleaning up for 2.5 \n(Things like __FUNCTION__ abuse and the like). 2.4 doesn't even compile due \nto broken asm constraints and other such sillies. As 3.x isn't a recommended \ncompiler for 2.4, this isn't too important just yet. As more and more archs \nstart using 3.x for their standard compiler though, we should clean up some \nof this stuff for 2.5. The new warning Neil tipped me off about \n(-Wunused-macros) turns out far too much crap. From what I looked at, \nit was correct in most cases, and yes there were macros being defined \nbut being unused. Cleaning them up however creates a maintenance nightmare \nfor anyone with patches in those areas already. (This sort of cleanup \nparticularly hurts people like myself who have huge patches touching large \nparts of the tree). The recent gcc->c99 struct initialisers patch for instance \nmade large parts of my tree reject. With more to come, the fun isn't over yet either.\n\nthat is the CVS version, but it seems that more breakage is to come with the\nkernel :(\n\n(Everyone will want to compile their machine on the latest greatest... I think\nthey eventually persuaded Compaq's compiler to compile the kernel)...\n\nL.\n-- \n     dBP   dBBBBb | If you're looking at me to be an accountant\n              dBP | Then you will look but you will never see\n   dBP    dBBBK'  | If you're looking at me to start having babies\n  dBP    dB' db   | Then you can wish because I'm not here to fool around\n dBBBBP dBBBBP'   | Belle & Sebastian (Family Tree)\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
