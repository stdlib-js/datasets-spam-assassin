I have had a google around and the PHP site wasn't help full and the GPL page didn't seem to have this senario.\n\nThe setup is as follows:\nI develop a piece of code using PHP 3.0.9 which is, to\nmy knowledge, GPL. \n\nThe piece of code runs on my server and is an integral part of a system that I have developed for a client. I did not recieve  payment for this particular piece of code but I did recieve payment for the system. My client now wants to  \nuse a different service provider but keep my code. \nDo I have a right to claim intellectual property rights for  my little piece of code that he did not pay me for or do I have to give the client the code under the GPL.\n\nI know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated\n\nAnt\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"}
